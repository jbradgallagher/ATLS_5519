A Grave 

Man looking into the sea, 
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as 
     you have to it yourself, 
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing, 
but you cannot stand in the middle of this; 
the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave. 
The firs stand in a procession, each with an emerald turkey
nbsp;     foot at the top, 
reserved as their contours, saying nothing; 
repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of 
     the sea; 
the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look. 
There are others besides you who have worn that look -whose 
expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer 
     investigate them 
for their bones have not lasted: 
men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are 
     desecrating a grave, 
and row quickly away -- the blades of the oars 
moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were 
     no such thing as death. 
The wrinkles progress among themselves in a phalanx -- beautiful 
     under networks of foam, 
and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the 
     seaweed; 
the birds swim throught the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls 
     as heretofore -the 
tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion 
     beneath them; 
and the ocean, under the pulsation of lighthouses and noise of 
     bell-buoys, 
advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which 
     dropped things are bound to sink -in 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor 
     consciousness. 




An Octopus 

of ice. Deceptively reserved and flat, 
it lies 'in grandeur and in mass' 
beneath a sea of shifting snow-dunes; 
dots of cyclamen-red and maroon on its clearly defined 
pseudo-podia 
made of glass that will bend–a much needed invention– 
comprising twenty-eight ice-fields from fifty to five hundred 
feet thick, 
of unimagined delicacy. 
'Picking periwinkles from the cracks' 
or killing prey with the concentric crushing rigor of the python, 
it hovers forward 'spider fashion 
on its arms' misleading like lace; 
its 'ghostly pallor changing 
to the green metallic tinge of an anemone-starred pool.' 
The fir-trees, in 'the magnitude of their root systems,' 
rise aloof from these maneuvers 'creepy to behold,' 
austere specimens of our American royal families, 
'each like the shadow of the one beside it. 
The rock seems frail compared with the dark energy of life,' 
its vermilion and onyx and manganese-blue interior expensiveness 
left at the mercy of the weather; 
'stained transversely by iron where the water drips down,' 
recognized by its plants and its animals. 
Completing a circle, 
you have been deceived into thinking that you have progressed, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
under the polite needles of the larches 
'hung to filter, not to intercept the sunlight'– 
met by tightly wattled spruce-twigs 
'conformed to an edge like clipped cypress 
as if no branch could penetrate the cold beyond its company'; 
and dumps of gold and silver ore enclosing The Goat’s Mirror– 
that lady-fingerlike depression in the shape of the left human 
foot, 
which prejudices you in favor of itself 
before you have had time to see the others; 
its indigo, pea-green, blue-green, and turquoise, 
from a hundred to two hundred feet deep, 
'merging in irregular patches in the middle of the lake 



where, like gusts of a storm 
obliterating the shadows of the fir-trees, the wind makes lanes 
of ripples.' 
What spot could have merits of equal importance 
for bears, elks, deer, wolves, goats, and ducks? 
Pre-empted by their ancestors, 
this is the property of the exacting porcupine, 
and of the rat 'slipping along to its burrow in the swamp 
or pausing on high ground to smell the heather'; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
of 'thoughtful beavers 
making drains which seem the work of careful men with shovels,' 
and of the bears inspecting unexpectedly 
ant-hills and berry-bushes. 
Composed of calcium gems and alabaster pillars, 
topaz, tourmaline crystals and amethyst quartz, 
their den in somewhere else, concealed in the confusion 
of 'blue forests thrown together with marble and jasper and agate 
as if the whole quarries had been dynamited.' 
And farther up, in a stag-at-bay position 
as a scintillating fragment of these terrible stalagmites, 
stands the goat, 
its eye fixed on the waterfall which never seems to fall– 
an endless skein swayed by the wind, 
immune to force of gravity in the perspective of the peaks. 
A special antelope 
acclimated to 'grottoes from which issue penetrating draughts 
which make you wonder why you came,' 
it stands it ground 
on cliffs the color of the clouds, of petrified white vapor– 
black feet, eyes, nose, and horns, engraved on dazzling ice-fields, 
the ermine body on the crystal peak; 
the sun kindling its shoulders to maximum heat like acetylene, 
dyeing them white– 
upon this antique pedestal, 
'a mountain with those graceful lines which prove it a volcano,' 
its top a complete cone like Fujiyama’s 
till an explosion blew it off. 
Distinguished by a beauty 
of which 'the visitor dare never fully speak at home 
for fear of being stoned as an impostor,' 
Big Snow Mountain is the home of a diversity of creatures: 
those who 'have lived in hotels 



but who now live in camps–who prefer to'; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
the mountain guide evolving from the trapper, 
'in two pairs of trousers, the outer one older, 
wearing slowly away from the feet to the knees'; 
'the nine-striped chipmunk 
running with unmammal-like agility along a log'; 
the water ouzel 
with 'its passion for rapids and high-pressured falls,' 
building under the arch of some tiny Niagara; 
the white-tailed ptarmigan 'in winter solid white, 
feeding on heather-bells and alpine buckwheat'; 
and the eleven eagles of the west, 
'fond of the spring fragrance and the winter colors,' 
used to the unegoistic action of the glaciers 
and 'several hours of frost every midsummer night.' 
'They make a nice appearance, don’t they,' 
happy see nothing? 
Perched on treacherous lava and pumice– 
those unadjusted chimney-pots and cleavers 
which stipulate 'names and addresses of persons to notify 
in case of disaster'– 
they hear the roar of ice and supervise the water 
winding slowly through the cliffs, 
the road 'climbing like the thread 
which forms the groove around a snail-shell, 
doubling back and forth until where snow begins, it ends.' 
No 'deliberate wide-eyed wistfulness' is here 
among the boulders sunk in ripples and white water 
where 'when you hear the best wild music of the forest 
it is sure to be a marmot,' 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
the victim on some slight observatory, 
of 'a struggle between curiosity and caution,' 
inquiring what has scared it: 
a stone from the moraine descending in leaps, 
another marmot, or the spotted ponies with glass eyes, 
brought up on frosty grass and flowers 
and rapid draughts of ice-water. 
Instructed none knows how, to climb the mountain, 
by business men who require for recreation 
three hundred and sixty-five holidays in the year, 
these conspicuously spotted little horses are peculiar; 
hard to discern among the birch-trees, ferns, and lily-pads, 



avalanche lilies, Indian paint-brushes, 
bear’s ears and kittentails, 
and miniature cavalcades of chlorophylless fungi 
magnified in profile on the moss-beds like moonstones in the water; 
the cavalcade of calico competing 
with the original American menagerie of styles 
among the white flowers of the rhododendron surmounting 
rigid leaves 
upon which moisture works its alchemy, 
transmuting verdure into onyx. 

'Like happy souls in Hell,' enjoying mental difficulties, 
the Greeks 
amused themselves with delicate behavior 
because it was 'so noble and fair'; 
not practised in adapting their intelligence 
to eagle-traps and snow-shoes, 
to alpenstocks and other toys contrived by those 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
'alive to the advantage of invigorating pleasures.' 
Bows, arrows, oars, and paddles, for which trees provide the 
wood, 
in new countries more eloquent than elsewhere– 
augmenting the assertion that, essentially humane, 
'the forest affords wood for dwellings and by its beauty 
stimulates the moral vigor of its citizens.' 
The Greeks liked smoothness, distrusting what was back 
of what could not be clearly seen, 
resolving with benevolent conclusiveness, 
'complexities which still will be complexities 
as long as the world lasts'; 
ascribing what we clumsily call happiness, 
to 'an accident or a quality, 
a spiritual substance or the soul itself, 
an act, a disposition, or a habit, 
or a habit infused, to which the soul has been persuaded, 
or something distinct from a habit, a power'– 
such power as Adam had and we are still devoid of. 
'Emotionally sensitive, their hearts were hard'; 
their wisdom was remote 
from that of these odd oracles of cool official sarcasm, 
upon this game preserve 
where 'guns, nets, seines, traps, and explosives, 



hired vehicles, gambling and intoxicants are prohibited; 
disobedient persons being summarily removed 
and not allowed to return without permission in writing.' 
It is self-evident 
that it is frightful to have everything afraid of one; 
that one must do as one is told 
and eat rice, prunes, dates, raisins, hardtack, and tomatoes 
this fossil flower concise without a shiver, 
intact when it is cut, 
damned for its sacrosanct remoteness– 
like Henry James 'damned by the public for decorum'; 
not decorum, but restraint; 
it is the love of doing hard things 
that rebuffed and wore them out–a public out of sympathy 
with neatness. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Neatness of finish! Neatness of finish! 
Relentless accuracy is the nature of this octopus 
with its capacity for fact. 
'Creeping slowly as with meditated stealth, 
its arms seeming to approach from all directions,' 
it receives one under winds that 'tear the snow to bits 
and hurl it like a sandblast 
shearing off twigs and loose bark from the trees.' 
Is 'tree' the word for these things 
'flat on the ground like vines'? 
some 'bent in a half circle with branches on one side 
suggesting dust-brushes, not trees; 
some finding strength in union, forming little stunted grooves 
their flattened mats of branches shrunk in trying to escape' 
from the hard mountain 'planned by ice and polished by the wind'– 
the white volcano with no weather side; 
the lightning flashing at its base, 
rain falling in the valleys, and snow falling on the peak– 
the glassy octopus symmetrically pointed, 
its claw cut by the avalanche 
'with a sound like the crack of a rifle, 
in a curtain of powdered snow launched like a waterfall.' 




Appellate Jurisdiction 

Fragments of sin are a part of me. 
New brooms shall sweep clean the heart of me.

Baseball And Writing 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Fanaticism?ng is exciting 
and baseball is like writing. 
You can never tell with either 
how it will go 
or what you will do; 
generating excitement-a 
fever in the victim-pitcher, 
catcher, fielder, batter. 
Victim in what category? 
Owlman watching from the press box? 
To whom does it apply? 
Who is excited?Might it be I? 

It's a pitcher's battle all the way--a duel-a 
catcher's, as, with cruel 
puma paw, Elston Howard lumbers lightly 
back to plate.(His spring 
de-winged a bat swing.) 
They have that killer instinct; 
yet Elston--whose catching 
arm has hurt them all with the bat-when 
questioned, says, unenviously, 
"I'm very won." 
Shorn of the batting crown, says, "We"; 
robbed by a technicality. 

When three players on a side play three positions 
and modify conditions, 
the massive run need not be everything. 
"Going, going . . . "Is 
it?Roger Maris 
has it, running will 
never see a finer . . . 
"Mickey, leaping like the devil"--why 
gild it, although deer sounds better-snares 
what was speeding towards its treetop nest, 
one-handing the souvenir-to-be 
meant to be caught by you or me.

Assign Yogi Berra to Cape Canaveral; 
he could handle any missile. 
He is no feather."Strike! . . . Strike two!" 
Fouled back.A blur. 
It's would infer 
that the bat had eyes. 
He put the wood to that one. 
Praised, Skowron says, "Thanks, Mel. 
I think I helped a little bit." 
All business, each, and modesty. 
Blanchard, Richardson, Kubek, Boyer. 
In that galaxy of nine, say which 
won the pennant?Each.It was he. 

Those two magnificent saves from the knee-throws 
by Boyer, finesses in twos-like 
Whitey's three kinds of pitch and prediagnosis 
with pick-off psychosis. 
Pitching is a large subject. 
Your arm, too true at first, can learn to 
catch your corners--even trouble 
Mickey Mantle.("Grazed a Yankee! 
My baby pitcher, Montejo!" 
With some pedagogy, 
you'll be tough, premature prodigy.) 

They crowd him and curve him and aim for the g

"I can stand here, bat held steady." 
One may suit him; 
none has hit him. 
Imponderables smite him. 
Muscle kinks, infections, spike wounds 
require food, rest, respite from ruffians.(Drat it! 
Celebrity costs privacy!) 
Cow's milk, "tiger's milk," soy milk, carrot juice, 
brewer's yeast (high-potency-concentrates

Mr. Houk and Mr. Sain,

Studded with stars in belt and crown, 
the Stadium is an adastrium. 
O flashing Orion, 
your stars are muscled like the lion. 




He "Digesteth Harde Yron" 

Although the aepyornis 
or roc that lived in Madagascar, and 
the moa are extinct, 
the camel-sparrow, linked 
with them in size--the large sparrow 
Xenophon saw walking by a stream--was and is 
a symbol of justice. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
This bird watches his chicks with 
a maternal concentration-and he's 
been mothering the eggs 
at night six weeks--his legs 
their only weapon of defense. 
He is swifter than a horse; he has a foot hard 
as a hoof; the leopard 

is not more 
could he, prized for plumes and eggs and young 
used even as a riding-beast, respect men 
hiding actor-like in ostrich skins, with the right hand 
making the neck move as if alive 
and from a bag the left hand strewing grain, that ostriches 

might be decoyed and killed!Yes, this is he 
whose plume was anciently 
the plume of justice; he 
whose comic duckling head on its 
great neck revolves with compass-needle nervousness 
when he stands guard, 

in S-like foragings as he is 
preening the down on his leaden-skinned back. 
The egg piously shown 
as Leda's very own 
from which Castor and Pollux hatched, 
was an what could have been more fit 
for the Chinese lawn it 

grazed on as a gift to an 



emperor who admired strange birds, than this 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
one, who builds his mud-made 
nest in dust yet will wade 
in lake or sea till only the head shows. 

.	.	.	.	.	.	. 

Six hundred ostrich-brains served 
at one banquet, the ostrich-plume-tipped tent 
and desert spear, jewel-
gorgeous ugly egg-shell 
goblets, eight pairs of ostriches 
in harness, dramatize a meaning 
always missed by the externalist. 

The power of the visible 
is the invisible; as even where 
no tree of freedom grows, 
so-called brute courage knows. 
Heroism is exhausting, yet 
it contradicts a greed that did not wisely spare 
the harmless solitaire 

or great auk in its grandeur; 
unsolicitude having swallowed up 
all giant birds but an alert gargantuan 
little-winged, magnificently speedy running-bird. 
This one remaining rebel 
is the sparrow-camel. 




He Made This Screen 

not of silver nor of coral, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
but of weatherbeaten laurel. 

Here, he introduced a sea 
uniform like tapestry; 

here, a fig-tree; there, a face; 
there, a dragon circling space -


designating here, a bower; 
there, a pointed passion-flower. 




His Shield 

The pin-swin or spine-swine 
(the edgehog miscalled hedgehog) with all his edges out, 
echidna and echinoderm in distressed-
pin-cushion thorn-fur coats, the spiny pig or porcupine, 
the rhino with horned snout– 
everything is battle-dressed. 

Pig-fur won’t do, I’ll wrap 
myself in salamander-skin like Presbyter John. 
A lizard in the midst of flames, a firebrand 
that is life, asbestos-eyed asbestos-eared, with tattooed nap 
and permanent pig on 
the instep; he can withstand 

fire and won’t drown. In his 
unconquerable country of unpompous gusto, 
gold was so common none considered it; greed 
and flattery were unknown. Though rubies large as tennis-
balls conjoined in streams so 
that the mountain seemed to bleed, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

the inextinguishable 
salamander styled himself but presbyter. His shield 
was his humility. In Carpasian 
linen coat, flanked by his household lion-cubs and sable 
retinue, he revealed 
a formula safer than 

an armorer’s: the power of relinquishing 
what one would keep; that is freedom. Become dinosaur-
skulled, quilled or salamander-wooled, more ironshod 
and javelin-dressed than a hedgehog battalion of steel, but be 
dull. Don’t be envied or 
armed with a measuring rod. 




Marriage 

This institution, 
perhaps one should say enterprise 
out of respect for which 
one says one need not change one's mind 
about a thing one has believed in, 
requiring public promises 
of one's intention 
to fulfill a private obligation: 
I wonder what Adam and Eve 
think of it by this time, 
this firegilt steel 
alive with goldenness; 
how bright it shows -"
of circular traditions and impostures, 
committing many spoils," 
requiring all one's criminal ingenuity 
to avoid! 
Psychology which explains everything 
explains nothing 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and we are still in doubt. 
Eve: beautiful woman -I 
have seen her 
when she was so handsome 
she gave me a start, 
able to write simultaneously 
in three languages -English, 
German and French 
and talk in the meantime; 
equally positive in demanding a commotion 
and in stipulating quiet: 
"I should like to be alone;" 
to which the visitor replies, 
"I should like to be alone; 
why not be alone together?" 
Below the incandescent stars 
below the incandescent fruit, 
the strange experience of beauty; 
its existence is too much; 
it tears one to pieces 



and each fresh wave of consciousness 
is poison. 
"See her, see her in this common world," 
the central flaw 
in that first crystal-fine experiment, 
this amalgamation which can never be more 
than an interesting possibility, 
describing it 
as "that strange paradise 
unlike flesh, gold, or stately buildings, 
the choicest piece of my life: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
the heart rising 
in its estate of peace 
as a boat rises 
with the rising of the water;" 
constrained in speaking of the serpent -that 
shed snakeskin in the history of politeness 
not to be returned to again -that 
invaluable accident 
exonerating Adam. 
And he has beauty also; 
it's distressing -- the O thou 
to whom, from whom, 
without whom nothing -- Adam; 
"something feline, 
something colubrine" -- how true! 
a crouching mythological monster 
in that Persian miniature of emerald mines, 
raw silk -- ivory white, snow white, 
oyster white and six others -that 
paddock full of leopards and giraffes -long 
lemonyellow bodies 
sown with trapezoids of blue. 
Alive with words, 
vibrating like a cymbal 
touched before it has been struck, 
he has prophesied correctly -the 
industrious waterfall, 
"the speedy stream 
which violently bears all before it, 
at one time silent as the air 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and now as powerful as the wind." 



"Treading chasms 
on the uncertain footing of a spear," 
forgetting that there is in woman 
a quality of mind 
which is an instinctive manifestation 
is unsafe, 
he goes on speaking 
in a formal, customary strain 
of "past states," the present state, 
seals, promises, 
the evil one suffered, 
the good one enjoys, 
hell, heaven, 
everything convenient 
to promote one's joy." 
There is in him a state of mind 
by force of which, 
perceiving what it was not 
intended that he should, 
"he experiences a solemn joy 
in seeing that he has become an idol." 
Plagued by the nightingale 
in the new leaves, 
with its silence -not 
its silence but its silences, 
he says of it: 
"It clothes me with a shirt of fire." 
"He dares not clap his hands 
to make it go on 
lest it should fly off; 
if he does nothing, it will sleep; 
if he cries out, it will not understand." 
Unnerved by the nightingale 
and dazzled by the apple, 
impelled by "the illusion of a fire 
effectual to extinguish fire," 
compared with which 
the shining of the earth 
is but deformity -- a fire 
"as high as deep as bright as broad 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
as long as life itself," 
he stumbles over marriage, 



"a very trivial object indeed" 
to have destroyed the attitude 
in which he stood -the 
ease of the philosopher 
unfathered by a woman. 
Unhelpful Hymen! 
"a kind of overgrown cupid" 
reduced to insignificance 
by the mechanical advertising 
parading as involuntary comment, 
by that experiment of Adam's 
with ways out but no way in -the 
ritual of marriage, 
augmenting all its lavishness; 
its fiddle-head ferns, 
lotus flowers, opuntias, white dromedaries, 
its hippopotamus -nose 
and mouth combined 
in one magnificent hopper, 
"the crested screamer -that 
huge bird almost a lizard," 
its snake and the potent apple. 
He tells us 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
that "for love 
that will gaze an eagle blind, 
that is like a Hercules 
climbing the trees 
in the garden of the Hesperides, 
from forty-five to seventy 
is the best age," 
commending it 
as a fine art, as an experiment, 
a duty or as merely recreation. 
One must not call him ruffian 
nor friction a calamity -the 
fight to be affectionate: 
"no truth can be fully known 
until it has been tried 
by the tooth of disputation." 
The blue panther with black eyes, 
the basalt panther with blue eyes, 
entirely graceful -




one must give them the path -the 
black obsidian Diana 
who "darkeneth her countenance 
as a bear doth, 
causing her husband to sigh," 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
the spiked hand 
that has an affection for one 
and proves it to the bone, 
impatient to assure you 
that impatience is the mark of independence 
not of bondage. 
"Married people often look that way" -"
seldom and cold, up and down, 
mixed and malarial 
with a good day and bad." 
"When do we feed?" 
We occidentals are so unemotional, 
we quarrel as we feed; 
one's self is quite lost, 
the irony preserved 
in "the Ahasuerus tête à tête banquet" 
with its "good monster, lead the way," 
with little laughter 
and munificence of humor 
in that quixotic atmosphere of frankness 
in which "Four o'clock does not exist 
but at five o'clock 
the ladies in their imperious humility 
are ready to receive you"; 
in which experience attests 
that men have power 
and sometimes one is made to feel it. 
He says, "what monarch would not blush 
to have a wife 
with hair like a shaving-brush? 
The fact of woman 
is not `the sound of the flute 
but every poison.'" 
She says, "`Men are monopolists 
of stars, garters, buttons 
and other shining baubles' -unfit 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
to be the guardians 



of another person's happiness." 
He says, "These mummies 
must be handled carefully -`
the crumbs from a lion's meal, 
a couple of shins and the bit of an ear'; 
turn to the letter M 
and you will find 
that `a wife is a coffin,' 
that severe object 
with the pleasing geometry 
stipulating space and not people, 
refusing to be buried 
and uniquely disappointing, 
revengefully wrought in the attitude 
of an adoring child 
to a distinguished parent." 
She says, "This butterfly, 
this waterfly, this nomad 
that has `proposed 
to settle on my hand for life.' -What 
can one do with it? 
There must have been more time 
in Shakespeare's day 
to sit and watch a play. 
You know so many artists are fools." 
He says, "You know so many fools 
who are not artists." 
The fact forgot 
that "some have merely rights 
while some have obligations," 
he loves himself so much, 
he can permit himself 
no rival in that love. 
She loves herself so much, 
she cannot see herself enough -a 
statuette of ivory on ivory, 
the logical last touch 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
to an expansive splendor 
earned as wages for work done: 
one is not rich but poor 
when one can always seem so right. 
What can one do for them -




these savages 
condemned to disaffect 
all those who are not visionaries 
alert to undertake the silly task 
of making people noble? 
This model of petrine fidelity 
who "leaves her peaceful husband 
only because she has seen enough of him" -that 
orator reminding you, 
"I am yours to command." 
"Everything to do with love is mystery; 
it is more than a day's work 
to investigate this science." 
One sees that it is rare -that 
striking grasp of opposites 
opposed each to the other, not to unity, 
which in cycloid inclusiveness 
has dwarfed the demonstration 
of Columbus with the egg -a 
triumph of simplicity -that 
charitive Euroclydon 
of frightening disinterestedness 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
which the world hates, 
admitting: 

"I am such a cow, 
if I had a sorrow, 
I should feel it a long time; 
I am not one of those 
who have a great sorrow 
in the morning 
and a great joy at noon;" 
which says: "I have encountered it 
among those unpretentious 
protegés of wisdom, 
where seeming to parade 
as the debater and the Roman, 
the statesmanship 
of an archaic Daniel Webster 
persists to their simplicity of temper 
as the essence of the matter: 



`Liberty and union 
now and forever;' 

the book on the writing-table; 
the hand in the breast-pocket."

harm the roots; they still grow 
in frozen ground. Once where 
there was a prickley-pear 


leaf clinging to a barbed wire, 
a root shot down to grow 
in earth two feet below; 

as carrots from mandrakes 
or a ram's-horn root sometimes. 
Victory won't come 

to me unless I go 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
to it; a grape tendril 
ties a knot in knots till 

knotted thirty times - so 
the bound twig that's undergone 
and over-gone, can't stir. 

The weak overcomes its 
menace, the strong overcomes 
itself. What is there 



like fortitude! What sap 
went through that little thread 
to make the cherry red! 




Nine Nectarines And Other Porcelain 

Arranged by two's as peaches are, 
at intervals that all may live— 
eight and a single one, on twigs that 
grew the year before—they look like 
a derivative; 
although not uncommonly 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
the opposite is seen— 
nine peaches on a nectarine. 
Fuzzless through slender crescent leaves 
of green or blue or 
both, in the Chinese style, the four 

pairs' half-moon leaf-mosaic turns 
out to the sun the sprinkled blush 
of puce-American-Beauty pink 
applied to bees-wax gray by the 
uninquiring brush 
of mercantile bookbinding. 
Like the peach Yu , the red-
cheeked peach which cannot aid the dead, 
but eaten in time prevents death, 
'the Italian 
peach-nut, Persian plum, Ispahan 

secluded wall-grown nectarine, 
as wild spontaneous fruit was 
found in China first. But was it wild? 
Prudent de Candolle would not say. 
One perceives no flaws 
in this emblematic group 
of nine, with leaf window 
unquilted by curculio 
which someone once depicted on 
this much-mended plate 
or in the also accurate 

unantlered moose or Iceland horse 
or ass asleep against the old 
thick, low-leaning nectarine that is the 



color of the shrub-tree's brownish 
flower. 

***** 

A Chinese "understands 
the spirit of the wilderness" 
and the nectarine-loving kylin 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
of pony appearance—the long-
tailed or the tailless 
small cinnamon-brown, common 
camel-haired unicorn 
with antelope feet and no horn, 
here enameled on porcelain. 
It was a Chinese 
Who imagined this masterpiece. 




No Swan So Fine 

"No water so still as the 
dead fountains of Versailles." No swan, 
with swart blind look askance 
and gondoliering legs, so fine 
as the chinz china one with fawn-
brown eyes and toothed gold 
collar on to show whose bird it was. 

Lodged in the Louis Fifteenth 
candelabrum-tree of cockscomb-
tinted buttons, dahlias, 
sea-urchins, and everlastings, 
it perches on the branching foam 
of polished sculptured 
flowers--at ease and tall. The king is dead.

Peter 

Strong and slippery, built for the midnight grass-party confronted by four cats, 
he sleeps his time away -- the detached first claw on his foreleg which 
corresponds 
to the thumb, retracted to its tip; the small tuft of fronds 
or katydid legs above each eye, still numbering the units in each group; 
the shadbones regularly set about his mouth, to droop or rise 

in unison like the porcupine's quills -- motionless. He lets himself be flat­ 
tened out by gravity, as it were a piece of seaweed tamed and weakened by 
exposure to the sun; compelled when extended, to lie 
stationary. Sleep is the result of his delusion that one must do as 
well as one can for oneself; sleep -- epitome of what is to 

him as to the average person, the end of life. Demonstrate on him how 
the lady caught the dangerous southern snake, placing a forked stick on either 
side of its innocuous neck; one need not try to stir 
him up; his prune shaped head and alligator eyes are not a party to the 
joke. Lifted and handled, he may be dangled like an eel or set 

up on the forearm like a mouse; his eyes bisected by pupils of a pin's 
width, are flickeringly exhibited, then covered up. May be? I should say, 
might have been; when he has been got the better of in a 
dream -- as in a fight with nature or with cats -- we all know it. Profound sleep is 
not with him, a fixed illusion. Springing about with froglike ac­ 

curacy, emitting jerky cries when taken in the hand, he is himself 
again; to sit caged by the rungs of a domestic chair would be unprofit­ 
able -- human. What is the good of hypocrisy? It 
is permissible to choose one's employment, to abandon the wire nail, the 
roly-poly, when it shows signs of being no longer a pleas­ 

ure, to score the adjacent magazine with a double line of strokes. He can 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
talk, but insolently says nothing. What of it? When one is frank, one's very 
presence is a compliment. It is clear that he can see 
the virtue of naturalness, that he is one of those who do not regard 
the published fact as a surrender. As for the disposition 

invariably to affront, an animal with claws wants to have to use 
them; that eel-like extension of trunk into tail is not an accident. To 



leap, to lengthen out, divide the air -- to purloin, to pursue. 
to tell the hen: fly over the fence, go in the wrong way -- in your perturba­ 
tion -- this is life; to do less would be nothing but dishonesty. 




Poetry 

I, too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all 
this fiddle. 
Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one 
discovers in 
it after all, a place for the genuine. 
Hands that can grasp, eyes 
that can dilate, hair that can rise 
if it must, these things are important not because a 

high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because 
they are 
useful. When they become so derivative as to become 
unintelligible, 
the same thing may be said for all of us, that we 
do not admire what 
we cannot understand: the bat 
holding on upside down or in quest of something to 

eat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf 
under 
a tree, the immovable critic twitching his skin like a horse that 
feels a 
flea, the baseball 
fan, the statistician-nor 
is it valid 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
to discriminate against 'business documents and 

school-books'; all these phenomena are important. One must 
make a distinction 
however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the 
result is not poetry, 
nor till the poets among us can be 
'literalists of 
the imagination'--above 
insolence and triviality and can present 

for inspection, 'imaginary gardens with real toads in them', shall 
we have 
it. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand, 



the raw material of poetry in 
all its rawness and 
that which is on the other hand 
genuine, you are interested in poetry. 




Rosemary 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Beauty and Beauty's son and rosemary Venus 
and Love, her son, to speak plainly born 
of the sea supposedly, 
at Christmas each, in company, 
braids a garland of festivity. 
Not always rosemary 


since the flight to Egypt, blooming indifferently. 
With lancelike leaf, green but silver underneath, 
its flowers - white originally turned 
blue. The herb of memory, 
imitating the blue robe of Mary, 
is not too legendary 

to flower both as symbol and as pungency. 
Springing from stones beside the sea, 
the height of Christ when he was thirty-three, 
it feeds on dew and to the bee 
"hath a dumb language"; is in reality 
a kind of Christmas tree. 




Roses Only 

You do not seem to realize that beauty is a liability rather 
than 
an asset - that in view of the fact that spirit creates form 
we are justified in supposing 
that you must have brains. For you, a symbol of the 
unit, stiff and sharp, 
conscious of surpassing by dint of native superiority and 
liking for everything 
self-dependent, anything an 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

ambitious civilization might produce: for you, unaided, to 
attempt through sheer 
reserve, to confuse presumptions resulting from 
observation, is idle. You cannot make us 
think you a delightful happen-so. But rose, if you are 
brilliant, it 
is not because your petals are the without-which-nothing 
of pre-eminence. Would you not, minus 
thorns, be a what-is-this, a mere 
perculiarity? They are not proof against a worm, the 
elements, or mildew; 
but what about the predatory hand? What is brilliance 
without co-ordination? Guarding the 
infinitesimal pieces of your mind, compelling audience to 
the remark that it is better to be forgotten than to be remembered 
too violently, 
your thorns are the best part of you. 




Silence 

My father used to say, 
"Superior people never make long visits, 
have to be shown Longfellow's grave 
nor the glass flowers at Harvard. 
Self reliant like the cat -that 
takes its prey to privacy, 
the mouse's limp tail hanging like a shoelace from its mouth -they 
sometimes enjoy solitude, 
and can be robbed of speech 
by speech which has delighted them. 
The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence; 
not in silence, but restraint." 
Nor was he insincere in saying, "`Make my house your inn'." 
Inns are not residences. 




Spenser's Ireland 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
has not altered; a 
place as kind as it is green, 
the greenest place I've never seen. 
Every name is a tune. 
Denunciations do not affect 
the culprit; nor blows, but it 
is torture to him to not be spoken to. 
They're natural,the 
coat, like Venus' 
mantle lined with stars, 
buttoned close at the neck,-the sleeves new from disuse. 

If in Ireland 
they play the harp backward at need, 
and gather at midday the seed 
of the fern, eluding 
their 'giants all covered with iron,' might 
there be fern seed for unlearning 
obduracy and for reinstating 
the enchantment? 
Hindered characters 
seldom have mothers 
in Irish stories, but they all have grandmothers. 

It was Irish; 
a match not a marriage was made 
when my great great grandmother'd said 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
with native genius for 
disunion, 'Although your suitor be 
perfection, one objection 
is enough; he is not 
Irish.' Outwitting 
the fairies, befriending the furies, 
whoever again 
and again says, 'I'll never give in,' never sees 

that you're not free 
until you've been made captive by 
supreme belief,- credulity 



you say? When large dainty 
fingers tremblingly divide the wings 
of the fly for mid-July 
with a needle and wrap it with peacock-tail, 
or tie wool and 
buzzard's wing, their pride, 
like the enchanter's 
is in care, not madness. Concurring hands divide 

flax for damask 
that when bleached by Irish weather 
has the silvered chamois-leather 
water-tightness of a 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
skin. Twisted torcs and gold new-moon-shaped 
lunulae aren't jewelry 
like the purple-coral fuchsia-tree's. Eire-
the guillemot 
so neat and the hen 
of the heath and the 
linnet spinet-sweet-bespeak relentlessness? Then 

they are to me 
like enchanted Earl Gerald who 
changed himself into a stag, to 
a great green-eyed cat of 
the mountain. Discommodity makes 
them invisible; they've disappeared. 
The Irish say your trouble is their 
trouble and your 
joy their joy? I wish 
I could believe it; 
I am troubled, I'm dissatisfied, I'm Irish. 




The Fish 

wade 
through black jade 
Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps 
adjusting the ash heaps; 
opening and shutting itself like 
an 
injured fan. 
The barnacles which encrust the side 
of the wave, cannot hide 
there for the submerged shafts of the 
sun, 
split like spun 
glass, move themselves with spotlight swiftness 
into the crevices– 
in and out, illuminating 
the 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
turquoise sea 
of bodies. The water drives a wedge 
of iron through the iron edge 
of the cliff; whereupon the stars, 
pink 
rice-grains, ink-
bespattered jelly-fish, crabs like green 
lilies, and submarine 
toadstools, slide each on the other. 
All 
external 
marks of abuse are present on this 
defiant edifice– 
all the physical features of 
accident–
lack 
of cornice, dynamite grooves, burns, and 
hatchet strokes, these things stand 
out on it; the chasm-side is 
dead. 
Repeated 
evidence has proved that it can live 
on what can not revive 



its youth. The sea grows old in it. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


The Mind is a wonderful Thing 

is an enchanted thing 
like the glaze on a 
katydid-wing 
subdivided by sun 
till the nettings are legion. 
Like Giesking playing Scarltti; 

like the apteryx-awl 
as a beak, or the 
kiwi's rain-shawl 
of haired feathers, the mind 
feeling its way as though blind, 
walks along with its eyes on the ground. 

It has memory's ear 
that can hear without 
having to hear. 
Like the gyroscope's fall, 
truly equivocal 
because trued by regnant certainty, 

it is a power of strong enchantment. It 
is like the dove-
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
neck animated by 
sun; it is memory's eye; 
it's conscientious inconsistency. 

It tears off the veil; tears 
the temptation, the 
mist the heart wears, 
from its eyes - if the heart 
has a face; it takes apart 
dejection. It's fire in the dove-neck's 

iridescence; in the inconsistencies 
of Scarlatti. 
Unconfusion submits 
its confusion to proof; it's 
not a Herod's oath that cannot change. 






The Pangolin 

Another armored animal–scale 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
lapping scale with spruce-cone regularity until they 
form the uninterrupted central 
tail row! This near artichoke with head and legs and 
grit-equipped gizzard, 
the night miniature artist engineer is, 
yes, Leonardo da Vinci’s replica– 
impressive animal and toiler of whom we seldom hear. 
Armor seems extra. But for him, 
the closing ear-ridge– 
or bare ear licking even this small 
eminence and similarly safe 
contracting nose and eye apertures 
impenetrably closable, are not;–a true ant-eater, 
not cockroach-eater, who endures 
exhausting solitary trips through unfamiliar ground at night, 
returning before sunrise; stepping in the moonlight, 
on the moonlight peculiarly, that the outside 
edges of his hands may bear the weight and save the 
claws 
for digging. Serpentined about 
the tree, he draws 
away from danger unpugnaciously, 
with no sound but a harmless hiss; keeping 
the fragile grace of the Thomas-
of-Leighton Buzzard Westminster Abbey wrought-iron 
vine, or 
rolls himself into a ball that has 
power to defy all effort to unroll it; strongly intailed, neat 
head for core, on neck not breaking off, with curled-in feet. 
Nevertheless he has sting-proof scales; and nest 
of rocks closed with earth from inside, which he can 
thus darken. 
Sun and moon and day and night and man and beast 
each with a splendor 
which man in all his vileness cannot 
set aside; each with an excellence! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
"Fearful yet to be feared," the armored 
ant-eater met by the driver-ant does not turn back, but 



engulfs what he can, the flattered sword-
edged leafpoints on the tail and artichoke set leg-and 
body-plates 
quivering violently when it retaliates 
and swarms on him. Compact like the furled fringed frill 
on the hat-brim of Gargallo’s hollow iron head of a 
matador, he will drop and will 
then walk away 
unhurt, although if unintruded on, 
he cautiously works down the tree, helped 
by his tail. The giant-pangolintail, 
graceful tool, as prop or hand or broom or ax, tipped like 
an elephant’s trunk with special skin, 
is not lost on this ant-and stone-swallowing uninjurable 
artichoke which simpletons thought a living fable 
whom the stones had nourished, whereas ants had done 
so. Pangolins are not aggressive animals; between 
dusk and day they have the not unchain-like machine-like 
form and frictionless creep of a thing 
made graceful by adversities, conversities. 
To explain grace requires 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
a curious hand. If that which is at all were not forever, 
why would those who graced the spires 
with animals and gathered there to rest, on cold luxurious 
low stone seats–a monk and monk and monk–between the 
thus 
ingenious roof-supports, have slaved to confuse 
grace with a kindly manner, time in which to pay a 
debt, 
the cure for sins, a graceful use 
of what are yet 
approved stone mullions branching out across 
the perpendiculars? A sailboat 
was the first machine. Pangolins, made 
for moving quietly also, are models of exactness, 
on four legs; on hind feet plantigrade, 
with certain postures of a man. Beneath sun and moon, 
man slaving 
to make his life more sweet, leaves half the flowers worth 
having, 
needing to choose wisely how to use his strength; 
a paper-maker like the wasp; a tractor of foodstuffs, 



like the ant; spidering a length 
of web from bluffs 
above a stream; in fighting, mechanicked 
like to pangolin; capsizing in 
disheartenment. Bedizened or stark 
naked, man, the self, the being we call human, writing-
master to this world, griffons a dark 
"Like does not like like that is obnoxious"; and writes error 
with four 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
r’s. Among animals, one has a sense of humor. 
Humor saves a few steps, it saves years. Uningnorant, 
modest and unemotional, and all emotion, 
he has everlasting vigor, 
power to grow, 
though there are few creatures who can make one 
breathe faster and make one erecter. 
Not afraid of anything is he, 
and then goes cowering forth, tread paced to meet an obstacle 
at every step. Consistent with the 
formula–warm blood, no gills, two pairs of hands and a few 
hairs–that 
is a mammal; there he sits in his own habitat, 
serge-clad, strong-shod. The prey of fear, he, always 
curtailed, extinguished, thwarted by the dusk, work 
partly done, 
says to the alternating blaze, 
"Again the sun! 
anew each day; and new and new and new, 
that comes into and steadies my soul." 




The Paper Nautilus 

For authorities whose hopes 
are shaped by mercenaries? 
Writers entrapped by 
teatime fame and by 
commuters' comforts? Not for these 
the paper nautilus 
constructs her thin glass shell. 

Giving her perishable 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
souvenir of hope, a dull 
white outside and smooth-
edged inner surface 
glossy as the sea, the watchful 
maker of it guards it 
day and night; she scarcely 

eats until the eggs are hatched. 
Buried eight-fold in her eight 
arms, for she is in 
a sense a devil-
fish, her glass ram'shorn-cradled freight 
is hid but is not crushed; 
as Hercules, bitten 

by a crab loyal to the hydra, 
was hindered to succeed, 
the intensively 
watched eggs coming from 
the shell free it when they are freed,-leaving 
its wasp-nest flaws 
of white on white, and close-

laid Ionic chiton-folds 
like the lines in the mane of 
a Parthenon horse, 
round which the arms had 
wound themselves as if they knew love 
is the only fortress 
strong enough to trust to. 






The Past Is The Present 

If external action is effete 
and rhyme is outmoded, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I shall revert to you, 
Habakkuk, as when in a Bible class 
the teacher was speaking of unrhymed verse. 
He said - and I think I repeat his exact words "
Hebrew poetry is prose 
with a sort of heightened consciousness." Ecstasy affords 
the occasion and expediency determines the form. 




The Steeple-Jack 

Dürer would have seen a reason for living 
in a town like this, with eight stranded whales 
to look at; with the sweet sea air coming into your house 
on a fine day, from water etched 
with waves as formal as the scales 
on a fish. 

One by one in two's and three's, the seagulls keep 
flying back and forth over the town clock, 
or sailing around the lighthouse without moving their wings -rising 
steadily with a slight 
quiver of the body -- or flock 
mewing where 

a sea the purple of the peacock's neck is 
paled to greenish azure as Dürer changed 
the pine green of the Tyrol to peacock blue and guinea 
gray. You can see a twenty-fivepound 
lobster; and fish nets arranged 
to dry. The 

whirlwind fife-and-drum of the storm bends the salt 
marsh grass, disturbs stars in the sky and the 
star on the steeple; it is a privilege to see so 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
much confusion. Disguised by what 
might seem the opposite, the seaside 
flowers and 

trees are favored by the fog so that you have 
the tropics first hand: the trumpet-vine, 
fox-glove, giant snap-dragon, a salpiglossis that has 
spots and stripes; morning-glories, gourds, 
or moon-vines trained on fishing-twine 
at the back door; 

cat-tails, flags, blueberries and spiderwort, 
striped grass, lichens, sunflowers, asters, daisies -yellow 
and crab-claw ragged sailors with green bracts -- toad-plant, 
petunias, ferns; pink lilies, blue 



ones, tigers; poppies; black sweet-peas. 
The climate 

is not right for the banyan, frangipani, or 
jack-fruit trees; or for exotic serpent 
life. Ring lizard and snake-skin for the foot, if you see fit; 
but here they've cats, not cobras, to 
keep down the rats. The diffident 
little newt 

with white pin-dots on black horizontal spaced-
out bands lives here; yet there is nothing that 
ambition can buy or take away. The college student 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
named Ambrose sits on the hillside 
with his not-native books and hat 
and sees boats 

at sea progress white and rigid as if in 
a groove. Liking an elegance of which 
the sourch is not bravado, he knows by heart the antique 
sugar-bowl shaped summer-house of 
interlacing slats, and the pitch 
of the church 

spire, not true, from which a man in scarlet lets 
down a rope as a spider spins a thread; 
he might be part of a novel, but on the sidewalk a 
sign says C. J. Poole, Steeple Jack, 
in black and white; and one in red 
and white says 

Danger. The church portico has four fluted 
columns, each a single piece of stone, made 
modester by white-wash. Theis would be a fit haven for 
waifs, children, animals, prisoners, 
and presidents who have repaid 
sin-driven 

senators by not thinking about them. The 
place has a school-house, a post-office in a 
store, fish-houses, hen-houses, a three-masted schooner on 
the stocks. The hero, the student, 



the steeple-jack, each in his way, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
is at home. 

It could not be dangerous to be living 
in a town like this, of simple people, 
who have a steeple-jack placing danger signs by the church 
while he is gilding the solid-
pointed star, which on a steeple 
stands for hope. 




To A Steam Roller 

The illustration 
is nothing to you without the application. 
You lack half wit. You crush all the particles down 
into close conformity, and then walk back and forth on them. 

Sparkling chips of rock 
are crushed down to the level of the parent block. 
Were not 'impersonal judment in aesthetic 
matters, a metaphysical impossibility,' you 

might fairly achieve 
it. As for butterflies, I can hardly conceive 
of one's attending upon you, but to question 
the congruence of the complement is vain, if it exists. 




To An Intra-Mural Rat 

You make me think of many men 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Once met, to be forgot again 
Or merely resurrected 
In a parenthesis of wit 
That found them hastening through it 
Too brisk to be inspected. 




What Are Years 

What is our innocence, 
what is our guilt? All are 
naked, none is safe. And whence 
is courage: the unanswered question, 
the resolute doubt, — 
dumbly calling, deafly listening—that 
in misfortune, even death, 
encourage others 
and in its defeat, stirs 
the soul to be strong? He 
sees deep and is glad, who 
accedes to mortality 
and in his imprisonment rises 
upon himself as 
the sea in a chasm, struggling to be 
free and unable to be, 
in its surrendering 
finds its continuing. 
So he who strongly feels, 
behaves. The very bird, 
grown taller as he sings, steels 
his form straight up. Though he is captive, 
his mighty singing 
says, satisfaction is a lowly 
thing, how pure a thing is joy. 
This is mortality, 
this is eternity.

I know noble accents 

And lucid, inescapable rhythms; 

But I know, too, 



That the blackbird is involved 
In what I know.

A Disillusionment Of Ten O'Clock 

The houses are haunted 
By white night-gowns. 
None are green, 
Or purple with green rings, 
Or green with yellow rings, 
Or yellow with blue rings. 
None of them are strange, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
With socks of lace 
And beaded ceintures. 
People are not going 
To dream of baboons and periwinkles. 
Only, here and there, an old sailor, 
Drunk and asleep in his boots, 
Catches Tigers 
In red weather. 




A High-Toned Old Christian Woman 

Poetry is the supreme fiction, madame. 
Take the moral law and make a nave of it 
And from the nave build haunted heaven. Thus, 
The conscience is converted into palms, 
Like windy citherns hankering for hymns. 
We agree in principle. That's clear. But take 
The opposing law and make a peristyle, 
And from the peristyle project a masque 
Beyond the planets. Thus, our bawdiness, 
Unpurged by epitaph, indulged at last, 
Is equally converted into palms, 
Squiggling like saxophones. And palm for palm, 
Madame, we are where we began. Allow, 
Therefore, that in the planetary scene 
Your disaffected flagellants, well-stuffed, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Smacking their muzzy bellies in parade, 
Proud of such novelties of the sublime, 
Such tink and tank and tunk-a-tunk-tunk, 
May, merely may, madame, whip from themselves 
A jovial hullabaloo among the spheres. 
This will make widows wince. But fictive things 
Wink as they will. Wink most when widows wince. 




A Postcard From The Volcano 

Children picking up our bones 
Will never know that these were once 
As quick as foxes on the hill; 

And that in autumn, when the grapes 
Made sharp air sharper by their smell 
These had a being, breathing frost; 

And least will guess that with our bones 
We left much more, left what still is 
The look of things, left what we felt 

At what we saw. The spring clouds blow 
Above the shuttered mansion house, 
Beyond our gate and the windy sky 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Cries out a literate despair. 
We knew for long the mansion's look 
And what we said of it became 

A part of what it is ... Children, 
Still weaving budded aureoles, 
Will speak our speech and never know, 

Will say of the mansion that it seems 
As if he that lived there left behind 
A spirit storming in blank walls, 

A dirty house in a gutted world, 
A tatter of shadows peaked to white, 
Smeared with the gold of the opulent sun. 




A Rabbit As King Of The Ghosts 

The difficulty to think at the end of day, 
When the shapeless shadow covers the sun 
And nothing is left except light on your fur— 

There was the cat slopping its milk all day, 
Fat cat, red tongue, green mind, white milk 
And August the most peaceful month. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

To be, in the grass, in the peacefullest time, 
Without that monument of cat, 
The cat forgotten in the moon; 

And to feel that the light is a rabbit-light, 
In which everything is meant for you 
And nothing need be explained; 

Then there is nothing to think of. It comes of itself; 
And east rushes west and west rushes down, 
No matter. The grass is full 

And full of yourself. The trees around are for you, 
The whole of the wideness of night is for you, 
A self that touches all edges, 

You become a self that fills the four corners of night. 
The red cat hides away in the fur-light 
And there you are humped high, humped up, 

You are humped higher and higher, black as stone— 
You sit with your head like a carving in space 
And the little green cat is a bug in the grass. 




Anecdote Of The Jar 

I placed a jar in Tennessee, 
And round it was, upon a hill. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
It made the slovenly wilderness 
Surround that hill. 

The wilderness rose up to it, 
And sprawled around, no longer wild. 
The jar was round upon the ground 
And tall and of a port in air. 

It took dominion everywhere. 
The jar was gray and bare. 
It did not give of bird or bush, 
Like nothing else in Tennessee. 




Another Weeping Woman 

Pour the unhappiness out 
From your too bitter heart, 
Which grieving will not sweeten. 

Poison grows in this dark. 
It is in the water of tears 
Its black blooms rise. 

The magnificent cause of being, 
The imagination, the one reality 
In this imagined world 

Leaves you 
With him for whom no phantasy moves, 
And you are pierced by a death. 




Bantams In Pine-Woods 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Chieftain Iffucan of Azcan in caftan 
Of tan with henna hackles, halt! 

Damned universal cock, as if the sun 
Was blackmoor to bear your blazing tail. 

Fat! Fat! Fat! Fat! I am the personal. 
Your world is you. I am my world. 

You ten-foot poet among inchlings. Fat! 
Begone! An inchling bristles in these pines, 

Bristles, and points their Appalachian tangs, 
And fears not portly Azcan nor his hoos. 




Continual Conversation With A Silent Man 

The old brown hen and the old blue sky, 
Between the two we live and die-The 
broken cartwheel on the hill. 

As if, in the presence of the sea, 
We dried our nets and mended sail 
And talked of never-ending things, 

Of the never-ending storm of will, 
One will and many wills, and the wind, 
Of many meanings in the leaves, 

Brought down to one below the eaves, 
Link, of that tempest, to the farm, 
The chain of the turquoise hen and sky 

And the wheel that broke as the cart went by. 
It is not a voice that is under the eaves. 
It is not speech, the sound we hear 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In this conversation, but the sound 
Of things and their motion: the other man, 
A turquoise monster moving round. 




Contrary Theses (Ii) 

One chemical afternoon in mid-autumn, 
When the grand mechanics of earth and sky were near; 
Even the leaves of the locust were yellow then, 

He walked with his year-old boy on his shoulder. 
The sun shone and the dog barked and the baby slept. 
The leaves, even of the locust, the green locust. 

He wanted and looked for a final refuge, 
From the bombastic intimations of winter 
And the martyrs a la mode. He walked toward 

An abstract, of which the sun, the dog, the boy 
Were contours. Cold was chilling the wide-moving swans. 
The leaves were falling like notes from a piano. 

The abstract was suddenly there and gone again. 
The negroes were playing football in the park. 
The abstract that he saw, like the locust-leaves, plainly: 

The premiss from which all things were conclusions, 
The noble, Alexandrine verve. The flies 
And the bees still sought the chrysanthemums’ odor. 




Disillusionment Of Ten O'Clock 

The houses are haunted 
By white night-gowns. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
None are green, 
Or purple with green rings, 
Or green with yellow rings, 
Or yellow with blue rings. 
None of them are strange, 
With socks of lace 
And beaded ceintures. 
People are not going 
To dream of baboons and periwinkles. 
Only, here and there, an old sailor, 
Drunk and asleep in his boots, 
Catches Tigers 
In red weather. 




Domination Of Black 

At night, by the fire, 
The colors of the bushes 
And of the fallen leaves, 
Repeating themselves, 
Turned in the room, 
Like the leaves themselves 
Turning in the wind. 
Yes: but the color of the heavy hemlocks 
Came striding. 
And I remembered the cry of the peacocks. 

The colors of their tails 
Were like the leaves themselves 
Turning in the wind, 
In the twilight wind. 
They swept over the room, 
Just as they flew from the boughs of the hemlocks 
Down to the ground. 
I heard them cry -- the peacocks. 
Was it a cry against the twilight 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Or against the leaves themselves 
Turning in the wind, 
Turning as the flames 
Turned in the fire, 
Turning as the tails of the peacocks 
Turned in the loud fire, 
Loud as the hemlocks 
Full of the cry of the peacocks? 
Or was it a cry against the hemlocks? 

Out of the window, 
I saw how the planets gathered 
Like the leaves themselves 
Turning in the wind. 
I saw how the night came, 
Came striding like the color of the heavy hemlocks 
I felt afraid. 
And I remembered the cry of the peacocks. 






Farewell To Florida 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

I 
Go on, high ship, since now, upon the shore, 
The snake has left its skin upon the floor. 
Key West sank downward under massive clouds 
And silvers and greens spread over the sea. The moon 
Is at the mast-head and the past is dead. 
Her mind will never speak to me again. 
I am free. High above the mast the moon 
Rides clear of her mind and the waves make a refrain 
Of this: that the snake has shed its skin upon 
The floor. Go on through the darkness. The waves fly back 

II 
Her mind had bound me round. The palms were hot 
As if I lived in ashen ground, as if 
The leaves in which the wind kept up its sound 
From my North of cold whistled in a sepulchral South, 
Her South of pine and coral and coraline sea, 
Her home, not mine, in the ever-freshened Keys, 
Her days, her oceanic nights, calling 
For music, for whisperings from the reefs. 
How content I shall be in the North to which I sail 
And to feel sure and to forget the bleaching sand ... 

III 
I hated the weathery yawl from which the pools 
Disclosed the sea floor and the wilderness 
Of waving weeds. I hated the vivid blooms 
Curled over the shadowless hut, the rust and bones, 
The trees likes bones and the leaves half sand, half sun. 
To stand here on the deck in the dark and say 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Farewell and to know that that land is forever gone 
And that she will not follow in any word 
Or look, nor ever again in thought, except 
That I loved her once ... Farewell. Go on, high ship. 



IV 
My North is leafless and lies in a wintry slime 
Both of men and clouds, a slime of men in crowds. 
The men are moving as the water moves, 
This darkened water cloven by sullen swells 
Against your sides, then shoving and slithering, 
The darkness shattered, turbulent with foam. 
To be free again, to return to the violent mind 
That is their mind, these men, and that will bind 
Me round, carry me, misty deck, carry me 
To the cold, go on, high ship, go on, plunge on. 




Final Soliloquy Of The Interior Paramour 

Light the first light of evening, as in a room 
In which we rest and, for small reason, think 
The world imagined is the ultimate good. 

This is, therefore, the intensest rendezvous. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
It is in that thought that we collect ourselves, 
Out of all the indifferences, into one thing: 

Within a single thing, a single shawl 
Wrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth, 
A light, a power, the miraculous influence. 

Here, now, we forget each other and ourselves. 
We feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, 
A knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous. 

Within its vital boundary, in the mind. 
We say God and the imagination are one... 
How high that highest candle lights the dark. 

Out of this same light, out of the central mind, 
We make a dwelling in the evening air, 
In which being there together is enough. 




Frogs Eat Butterflies, Snakes Eat Frogs, Hogs Eat 
Snakes, Men Eat Hogs 

It is true that the rivers went nosing like swine, 
Tugging at banks, until they seemed 
Bland belly-sounds in somnolent troughs, 

That the air was heavy with the breath of these swine, 
The breath of turgid summer, and 
Heavy with thunder's rattapallax, 

That the man who erected this cabin, planted 
This field, and tended it awhile, 
Knew not the quirks of imagery, 

That the hours of his indolent, arid days, 
Grotesque with this nosing in banks, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
This somnolence and rattapallax, 

Seemed to suckle themselves on his arid being, 
As the swine-like rivers suckled themselves 
While they went seaward to the sea-mouths. 




Gray Room 

Although you sit in a room that is gray, 
Except for the silver 
Of the straw-paper, 
And pick 
At your pale white gown; 
Or lift one of the green beads 
Of your necklace, 
To let it fall; 
Or gaze at your green fan 
Printed with the red branches of a red willow; 
Or, with one finger, 
Move the leaf in the bowl-The 
leaf that has fallen from the branches of the forsythia 
Beside you... 
What is all this? 
I know how furiously your heart is beating.

Hymn From A Watermelon Pavilion 

You dweller in the dark cabin, 
To whom the watermelon is always purple, 
Whose garden is wind and moon, 

Of the two dreams, night and day, 
What lover, what dreamer, would choose 
The one obscured by sleep? 

Here is the plantain by your door 
And the best cock of red feather 
That crew before the clocks. 

A feme may come, leaf-green, 
Whose coming may give revel 
Beyond revelries of sleep, 

Yes, and the blackbird spread its tail, 
So that the sun may speckle, 
While it creaks hail. 

You dweller in the dark cabin, 
Rise, since rising will not waken, 
And hail, cry hail, cry hail. 




In The Carolinas 

The lilacs wither in the Carolinas. 
Already the butterflies flutter above the cabins. 
Already the new-born children interpret love 
In the voices of mothers. 

Timeless mothers, 
How is it that your aspic nipples 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
For once vent honey? 

The pine-tree sweetens my body 
The white iris beautifies me. 




It Must Give Pleasure 

I 
To sing jubilas at exact, accustomed times, 
To be crested and wear the mane of a multitude 
And so, as part, to exult with its great throat, 

To speak of joy and to sing of it, borne on 
The shoulders of joyous men, to feel the heart 
That is the common, the bravest fundament, 

This is a facile exercise. Jerome 
Begat the tubas and the fire-wind strings, 
The golden fingers picking dark-blue air: 

For companies of voices moving there, 
To find of sound the bleakest ancestor, 
To find of light a music issuing 

Whereon it falls in more than sensual mode. 
But the difficultest rigor is forthwith, 
On the image of what we see, to catch from that 

Irrational moment its unreasoning, 
As when the sun comes rising, when the sea 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Clears deeply, when the moon hangs on the wall 

Of heaven-haven. These are not things transformed. 
Yet we are shaken by them as if they were. 
We reason about them with a later reason. 




Jasmine's Beautiful Thoughts Underneath the Willow 

My titillations have no foot-notes 
And their memorials are the phrases 
Of idiosyncratic music. 

The love that will not be transported 
In an old, frizzled, flambeaud manner, 
But muses on its eccentricity, 

Is like a vivid apprehension 
Of bliss beyond the mutes of plaster, 
Or paper souvenirs of rapture, 

Of bliss submerged beneath appearance, 
In an interior ocean's rocking 
Of long, capricious fugues and chorals. 




Le Monocle De Mon Oncle 

“Mother of heaven, regina of the clouds, 
O sceptre of the sun, crown of the moon, 
There is not nothing, no, no, never nothing, 
Like the clashed edges of two words that kill.” 
And so I mocked her in magnificent measure. 
Or was it that I mocked myself alone? 
I wish that I might be a thinking stone. 
The sea of spuming thought foists up again 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The radiant bubble that she was. And then 
A deep up-pouring from some saltier well 
Within me, bursts its watery syllable. 

II 
A red bird flies across the golden floor. 
It is a red bird that seeks out his choir 
Among the choirs of wind and wet and wing. 
A torrent will fall from him when he finds. 
Shall I uncrumple this much-crumpled thing? 
I am a man of fortune greeting heirs; 
For it has come that thus I greet the spring. 
These choirs of welcome choir for me farewell. 
No spring can follow past meridian. 
Yet you persist with anecdotal bliss 
To make believe a starry connaissance. 

III 
Is it for nothing, then, that old Chinese 
Sat tittivating by their mountain pools 
Or in the Yangtse studied out their beards? 
I shall not play the flat historic scale. 
You know how Utamaro’s beauties sought 
The end of love in their all-speaking braids. 
You know the mountainous coiffures of Bath. 
Alas! Have all the barbers lived in vain 
That not one curl in nature has survived? 
Why, without pity on these studious ghosts, 
Do you come dripping in your hair from sleep? 



IV 
This luscious and impeccable fruit of life 
Falls, it appears, of its own weight to earth. 
When you were Eve, its acrid juice was sweet, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Untasted, in its heavenly, orchard air. 
An apple serves as well as any skull 
To be the book in which to read a round, 
And is as excellent, in that it is composed 
Of what, like skulls, comes rotting back to ground. 
But it excels in this, that as the fruit 
Of love, it is a book too mad to read 
Before one merely reads to pass the time. 

V 
In the high west there burns a furious star. 
It is for fiery boys that star was set 
And for sweet-smelling virgins close to them. 
The measure of the intensity of love 
Is measure, also, of the verve of earth. 
For me, the firefly’s quick, electric stroke 
Ticks tediously the time of one more year. 
And you? Remember how the crickets came 
Out of their mother grass, like little kin, 
In the pale nights, when your first imagery 
Found inklings of your bond to all that dust. 

VI 
If men at forty will be painting lakes 
The ephemeral blues must merge for them in one, 
The basic slate, the universal hue. 
There is a substance in us that prevails. 
But in our amours amorists discern 
Such fluctuations that their scrivening 
Is breathless to attend each quirky turn. 
When amorists grow bald, then amours shrink 
Into the compass and curriculum 
Of introspective exiles, lecturing. 
It is a theme for Hyacinth alone. 

VII 
The mules that angels ride come slowly down 
The blazing passes, from beyond the sun. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>



Descensions of their tinkling bells arrive. 
These muleteers are dainty of their way. 
Meantime, centurions guffaw and beat 
Their shrilling tankards on the table-boards. 
This parable, in sense, amounts to this: 
The honey of heaven may or may not come, 
But that of earth both comes and goes at once. 
Suppose these couriers brought amid their train 
A damsel heightened by eternal bloom. 

VIII 
Like a dull scholar, I behold, in love, 
An ancient aspect touching a new mind. 
It comes, it blooms, it bears its fruit and dies. 
This trivial trope reveals a way of truth. 
Our bloom is gone. We are the fruit thereof. 
Two golden gourds distended on our vines, 
Into the autumn weather, splashed with frost, 
Distorted by hale fatness, turned grotesque. 
We hang like warty squashes, streaked and rayed, 
The laughing sky will see the two of us 
Washed into rinds by rotting winter rains. 

IX 
In verses wild with motion, full of din, 
Loudened by cries, by clashes, quick and sure 
As the deadly thought of men accomplishing 
Their curious fates in war, come, celebrate 
The faith of forty, ward of Cupido. 
Most venerable heart, the lustiest conceit 
Is not too lusty for your broadening. 
I quiz all sounds, all thoughts, all everything 
For the music and manner of the paladins 
To make oblation fit. Where shall I find 
Bravura adequate to this great hymn? 

X 
The fops of fancy in their poems leave 
Memorabilia of the mystic spouts, 
Spontaneously watering their gritty soils. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I am a yeoman, as such fellows go. 
I know no magic trees, no balmy boughs, 



No silver-ruddy, gold-vermilion fruits. 
But, after all, I know a tree that bears 
A semblance to the thing I have in mind. 
It stands gigantic, with a certain tip 
To which all birds come sometime in their time. 
But when they go that tip still tips the tree. 

XI 
If sex were all, then every trembling hand 
Could make us squeak, like dolls, the wished-for words. 
But note the unconscionable treachery of fate, 
That makes us weep, laugh, grunt and groan, and shout 
Doleful heroics, pinching gestures forth 
From madness or delight, without regard 
To that first, foremost law. Anguishing hour! 
Last night, we sat beside a pool of pink, 
Clippered with lilies scudding the bright chromes, 
Keen to the point of starlight, while a frog 
Boomed from his very belly odious chords. 

XII 
A blue pigeon it is, that circles the blue sky, 
On sidelong wing, around and round and round. 
A white pigeon it is, that flutters to the ground, 
Grown tired of flight. Like a dark rabbi, I 
Observed, when young, the nature of mankind, 
In lordly study. Every day, I found 
Man proved a gobbet in my mincing world. 
Like a rose rabbi, later, I pursued, 
And still pursue, the origin and course 
Of love, but until now I never knew 
That fluttering things have so distinct a shade.

Looking Across The Fields And Watching The Birds Fly 

Among the more irritating minor ideas 
Of Mr. Homburg during his visits home 
To Concord, at the edge of things, was this: 

To think away the grass, the trees, the clouds, 
Not to transform them into other things, 
Is only what the sun does every day, 

Until we say to ourselves that there may be 
A pensive nature, a mechanical 
And slightly detestable operandum, free 

From man's ghost, larger and yet a little like, 
Without his literature and without his gods . . . 
No doubt we live beyond ourselves in air, 

In an element that does not do for us, 
so well, that which we do for ourselves, too big, 
A thing not planned for imagery or belief, 

Not one of the masculine myths we used to make, 
A transparency through which the swallow weaves, 
Without any form or any sense of form, 

What we know in what we see, what we feel in what 
We hear, what we are, beyond mystic disputation, 
In the tumult of integrations out of the sky, 

And what we think, a breathing like the wind, 
A moving part of a motion, a discovery 
Part of a discovery, a change part of a change, 

A sharing of color and being part of it. 
The afternoon is visibly a source, 
Too wide, too irised, to be more than calm, 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Too much like thinking to be less than thought, 
Obscurest parent, obscurest patriarch, 
A daily majesty of meditation, 



That comes and goes in silences of its own. 
We think, then as the sun shines or does not. 
We think as wind skitters on a pond in a field 

Or we put mantles on our words because 
The same wind, rising and rising, makes a sound 
Like the last muting of winter as it ends. 

A new scholar replacing an older one reflects 
A moment on this fantasia. He seeks 
For a human that can be accounted for. 

The spirit comes from the body of the world, 
Or so Mr. Homburg thought: the body of a world 
Whose blunt laws make an affectation of mind, 

The mannerism of nature caught in a glass 
And there become a spirit's mannerism, 
A glass aswarm with things going as far as they can.

Madame La Fleurie 

Weight him down, O side-stars, with the great weightings of 
the end. 
Seal him there. He looked in a glass of the earth and thought 
he lived in it. 
Now, he brings all that he saw into the earth, to the waiting 
parent. 
His crisp knowledge is devoured by her, beneath a dew. 

Weight him, weight, weight him with the sleepiness of the 
moon. 
It was only a glass because he looked in it. It was nothing he 
could be told. 
It was a language he spoke, because he must, yet did not know. 
It was a page he had found in the handbook of heartbreak. 

The black fugatos are strumming the blackness of black... 
The thick strings stutter the finial gutturals. 
He does not lie there remembering the blue-jay, say the jay. 
His grief is that his mother should feed on him, himself and 
what he saw, 
In that distant chamber, a bearded queen, wicked in her dead 
light.

Metaphors Of A Magnifico 

Twenty men crossing a bridge, 
Into a village, 
Are twenty men crossing twenty bridges, 
Into twenty villages, 
Or one man 
Crossing a single bridge into a village. 

This is old song 
That will not declare itself . . . 

Twenty men crossing a bridge, 
Into a village, 
Are 
Twenty men crossing a bridge 
Into a village. 

That will not declare itself 
Yet is certain as meaning . . . 

The boots of the men clump 
On the boards of the bridge. 
The first white wall of the village 
Rises through fruit-trees. 
Of what was it I was thinking? 
So the meaning escapes. 

The first white wall of the village... 
The fruit-trees...

No Possum, No Sop, No Taters 

He is not here, the old sun, 
As absent as if we were asleep. 

The field is frozen. The leaves are dry. 
Bad is final in this light. 

In this bleak air the broken stalks 
Have arms without hands. They have trunks 

Without legs or, for that, without heads. 
They have heads in which a captive cry 

Is merely the moving of a tongue. 
Snow sparkles like eyesight falling to earth, 

Like seeing fallen brightly away. 
The leaves hop, scraping on the ground. 

It is deep January. The sky is hard. 
The stalks are firmly rooted in ice. 

It is in this solitude, a syllable, 
Out of these gawky flitterings, 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Intones its single emptiness, 
The savagest hollow of winter-sound. 

It is here, in this bad, that we reach 
The last purity of the knowledge of good. 

The crow looks rusty as he rises up. 
Bright is the malice in his eye... 

One joins him there for company, 
But at a distance, in another tree. 




Nomad Exquisite 

As the immense dew of Florida 
Brings forth 
The big-finned palm 
And green vine angering for life, 

As the immense dew of Florida 
Brings forth hymn and hymn 
From the beholder, 
Beholding all these green sides 
And gold sides of green sides, 

And blessed mornings, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Meet for the eye of the young alligator, 
And lightning colors 
So, in me, comes flinging 
Forms, flames, and the flakes of flames. 




Not Ideas About The Thing But The Thing Itself 

At the earliest ending of winter, 
In March, a scrawny cry from outside 
Seemed like a sound in his mind. 

He knew that he heard it, 
A bird's cry, at daylight or before, 
In the early March wind. 

The sun was rising at six, 
No longer a battered panache above snow... 
It would have been outside. 

It was not from the vast ventriloquism 
Of sleep's faded papier-mache... 
The sun was coming from the outside. 

That scrawny cry--It was 
A chorister whose c preceded the choir. 
It was part of the colossal sun, 

Surrounded by its choral rings, 
Still far away. It was like 
A new knowledge of reality.

Oak Leaves are Hands 

In Hydaspia, by Howzen 
Lived a lady, Lady Lowzen, 
For whom what is was other things. 

Flora she was once. She was florid 
A bachelor of feen masquerie, 
Evasive and metamorphorid. 

Mac Mort she had been, ago, 
Twelve-legged in her ancestral hells, 
Weaving and weaving many arms. 

Even now, the centre of something else, 
Merely by putting hand to brow, 
Brooding on centuries like shells. 

As the acorn broods on former oaks 
In memorials of Northern sound, 
Skims the real for its unreal, 

So she in Hydaspia created 
Out of the movement of few words, 
Flora Lowzen invigorated 

Archaic and future happenings, 
In glittering seven-colored changes, 
By Howzen, the chromatic Lowzen. 




Of Modern Poetry 

The poem of the mind in the act of finding 
What will suffice. It has not always had 
To find: the scene was set; it repeated what 
Was in the script. 
Then the theatre was changed 
To something else. Its past was a souvenir. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

It has to be living, to learn the speech of the place. 
It has to face the men of the time and to meet 
The women of the time. It has to think about war 
And it has to find what will suffice. It has 
To construct a new stage. It has to be on that stage, 
And, like an insatiable actor, slowly and 
With meditation, speak words that in the ear, 
In the delicatest ear of the mind, repeat, 
Exactly, that which it wants to hear, at the sound 
Of which, an invisible audience listens, 
Not to the play, but to itself, expressed 
In an emotion as of two people, as of two 
Emotions becoming one. The actor is 
A metaphysician in the dark, twanging 
An instrument, twanging a wiry string that gives 
Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses, wholly 
Containing the mind, below which it cannot descend, 
Beyond which it has no will to rise. 
It must 
Be the finding of a satisfaction, and may 
Be of a man skating, a woman dancing, a woman 
Combing. The poem of the act of the mind. 




Peter Quince At The Clavier 

I 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Just as my fingers on these keys 
Make music, so the self-same sounds 
On my spirit make a music, too. 
Music is feeling, then, not sound; 
And thus it is that what I feel, 
Here in this room, desiring you, 

Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk, 
Is music. It is like the strain 
Waked in the elders by Susanna; 

Of a green evening, clear and warm, 
She bathed in her still garden, while 
The red-eyed elders, watching, felt 

The basses of their beings throb 
In witching chords, and their thin blood 
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna. 

II 

In the green water, clear and warm, 
Susanna lay. 
She searched 
The touch of springs, 
And found 
Concealed imaginings. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
She sighed, 
For so much melody. 

Upon the bank, she stood 
In the cool 
Of spent emotions. 
She felt, among the leaves, 
The dew 
Of old devotions. 



She walked upon the grass, 
Still quavering. 
The winds were like her maids, 
On timid feet, 
Fetching her woven scarves, 
Yet wavering. 

A breath upon her hand 
Muted the night. 
She turned -A 
cymbal crashed, 
Amid roaring horns. 

III 

Soon, with a noise like tambourines, 
Came her attendant Byzantines. 

They wondered why Susanna cried 
Against the elders by her side; 

And as they whispered, the refrain 
Was like a willow swept by rain. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame 
Revealed Susanna and her shame. 

And then, the simpering Byzantines 
Fled, with a noise like tambourines. 

IV 

Beauty is momentary in the mind -The 
fitful tracing of a portal; 
But in the flesh it is immortal. 

The body dies; the body's beauty lives. 
So evenings die, in their green going, 
A wave, interminably flowing. 
So gardens die, their meek breath scenting 
The cowl of winter, done repenting. 
So maidens die, to the auroral 



Celebration of a maiden's choral. 

Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings 
Of those white elders; but, escaping, 
Left only Death's ironic scraping. 
Now, in its immortality, it plays 
On the clear viol of her memory, 
And makes a constant sacrament of praise. 




Phases 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

I. 
There’s a little square in Paris, 
Waiting until we pass. 
They sit idly there, 
They sip the glass. 

There’s a cab-horse at the corner, 
There's rain. The season grieves. 
It was silver once, 
And green with leaves. 

There’s a parrot in a window, 
Will see us on parade, 
Hear the loud drums roll— 
And serenade. 

II. 
This was the salty taste of glory, 
That it was not 
Like Agamemnon’s story. 
Only, an eyeball in the mud, 
And Hopkins, 
Flat and pale and gory! 

III. 
But the bugles, in the night, 
Were wings that bore 
To where our comfort was; 

Arabesques of candle beams, 
Winding 
Through our heavy dreams; 

Winds that blew 
Where the bending iris grew; 

Birds of intermitted bliss, 
Singing in the night's abyss; 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Vines with yellow fruit, 
That fell 
Along the walls 
That bordered Hell. 

IV. 
Death's nobility again 
Beautified the simplest men. 
Fallen Winkle felt the pride 
Of Agamemnon 
When he died. 

What could London’s 
Work and waste 
Give him— 
To that salty, sacrificial taste? 

What could London’s 
Sorrow bring— 
To that short, triumphant sting? 




Poem Written At Morning 

A sunny day's complete Poussiniana 
Divide it from itself. It is this or that 
And it is not. 
By metaphor you paint 
A thing. Thus, the pineapple was a leather fruit, 
A fruit for pewter, thorned and palmed and blue, 
To be served by men of ice. 
The senses paint 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
By metaphor. The juice was fragranter 
Than wettest cinnamon. It was cribled pears 
Dripping a morning sap. 
The truth must be 
That you do not see, you experience, you feel, 
That the buxom eye brings merely its element 
To the total thing, a shapeless giant forced 
Upward. 
Green were the curls upon that head. 




Poetry Is A Destructive Force 

That's what misery is, 
Nothing to have at heart. 
It is to have or nothing. 
It is a thing to have, 
A lion, an ox in his breast, 
To feel it breathing there. 

Corazon, stout dog, 
Young ox, bow-legged bear, 
He tastes its blood, not spit. 

He is like a man 
In the body of a violent beast 
Its muscles are his own... 

The lion sleeps in the sun. 
Its nose is on its paws. 
It can kill a man. 




Repetitions of a Young Captain 

A tempest cracked on the theatre. Quickly, 
The wind beat in the roof and half the walls. 
The ruin stood still in an external world. 

It had been real. It was something overseas 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That I remembered, something that I remembered 
Overseas, that stood in an external world. 

It had been real. It was not now. The rip 
Of the wind and the glittering were real now, 
In the spectacle of a new reality. 

II 

The people sat in the theatre, in the ruin, 
As if nothing had happened. The dim actor spoke. 
His hands became his feelings. His thick shape 

Issued thin seconds glibly gapering. 
Then faintly encrusted, a tissue of the moon 
Walked toward him on the stage and they embraced. 




Sea Surface Full Of Clouds 

In that November off Tehuantepec, 
The slopping of the sea grew still one night 
And in the morning summer hued the deck 

And made one think of rosy chocolate 
And gilt umbrellas. Paradisal green 
Gave suavity to the perplexed machine 

Of ocean, which like limpid water lay. 
Who, then, in that ambrosial latitude 
Out of the light evolved the morning blooms, 

Who, then, evolved the sea-blooms from the clouds 
Diffusing balm in that Pacific calm? 
C'etait mon enfant, mon bijou, mon ame. 

The sea-clouds whitened far below the calm 
And moved, as blooms move, in the swimming green 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And in its watery radiance, while the hue 

Of heaven in an antique reflection rolled 
Round those flotillas. And sometimes the sea 
Poured brilliant iris on the glistening blue.

 II 

In that November off Tehuantepec 
The slopping of the sea grew still one night. 
At breakfast jelly yellow streaked the deck 

And made one think of chop-house chocolate 
And sham umbrellas. And a sham-like green 
Capped summer-seeming on the tense machine 

Of ocean, which in sinister flatness lay. 
Who, then, beheld the rising of the clouds 
That strode submerged in that malevolent sheen, 

Who saw the mortal massives of the blooms 



Of water moving on the water-floor? 
C'etait mon frere du ciel, ma vie, mon or. 

The gongs rang loudly as the windy booms 
Hoo-hooed it in the darkened ocean-blooms. 
The gongs grew still. And then blue heaven spread 

Its crystalline pendentives on the sea 
And the macabre of the water-glooms 
In an enormous undulation fled.

 III 

In that November off Tehuantepec, 
The slopping of the sea grew still one night 
And a pale silver patterned on the deck 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

And made one think of porcelain chocolate 
And pied umbrellas. An uncertain green, 
Piano-polished, held the tranced machine 

Of ocean, as a prelude holds and holds, 
Who, seeing silver petals of white blooms 
Unfolding in the water, feeling sure 

Of the milk within the saltiest spurge, heard, then, 
The sea unfolding in the sunken clouds? 
Oh! C'etait mon extase et mon amour. 

So deeply sunken were they that the shrouds, 
The shrouding shadows, made the petals black 
Until the rolling heaven made them blue, 

A blue beyond the rainy hyacinth, 
And smiting the crevasses of the leaves 
Deluged the ocean with a sapphire blue.

 IV 

In that November off Tehuantepec 
The night-long slopping of the sea grew still. 
A mallow morning dozed upon the deck 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And made one think of musky chocolate 
And frail umbrellas. A too-fluent green 
Suggested malice in the dry machine 

Of ocean, pondering dank stratagem. 
Who then beheld the figures of the clouds 
Like blooms secluded in the thick marine? 

Like blooms? Like damasks that were shaken off 
From the loosed girdles in the spangling must. 
C'etait ma foi, la nonchalance divine. 

The nakedness would rise and suddenly turn 
Salt masks of beard and mouths of bellowing, 
Would- But more suddenly the heaven rolled 

Its bluest sea-clouds in the thinking green, 
And the nakedness became the broadest blooms, 
Mile-mallows that a mallow sun cajoled.

 V 

In that November off Tehuantepec 
Night stilled the slopping of the sea. 
The day came, bowing and voluble, upon the deck, 

Good clown... One thought of Chinese chocolate 
And large umbrellas. And a motley green 
Followed the drift of the obese machine 

Of ocean, perfected in indolence. 
What pistache one, ingenious and droll, 
Beheld the sovereign clouds as jugglery 

And the sea as turquoise-turbaned Sambo, neat 
At tossing saucers- cloudy-conjuring sea? 
C'etait mon esprit batard, l'ignominie. 

The sovereign clouds came clustering. The conch 
Of loyal conjuration trumped. The wind 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of green blooms turning crisped the motley hue 



To clearing opalescence. Then the sea 
And heaven rolled as one and from the two 
Came fresh transfigurings of freshest blue. 




Six Significant Landscapes 

I 
An old man sits 
In the shadow of a pine tree 
In China. 
He sees larkspur, 
Blue and white, 
At the edge of the shadow, 
Move in the wind. 
His beard moves in the wind. 
The pine tree moves in the wind. 
Thus water flows 
Over weeds.

	II 
The night is of the colour 
Of a woman's arm: 
Night, the female, 
Obscure, 
Fragrant and supple, 
Conceals herself. 
A pool shines, 
Like a bracelet 
Shaken in a dance.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

	III 
I measure myself 
Against a tall tree. 
I find that I am much taller, 
For I reach right up to the sun, 
With my eye; 
And I reach to the shore of the sea 
With my ear. 
Nevertheless, I dislike 
The way ants crawl 
In and out of my shadow.

	IV 
When my dream was near the moon, 
The white folds of its gown 



Filled with yellow light. 
The soles of its feet 
Grew red. 
Its hair filled 
With certain blue crystallizations 
From stars, 
Not far off.

	V 

Not all the knives of the lamp-posts, 

Nor the chisels of the long streets, 

Nor the mallets of the domes 

And high towers, 

Can carve 

What one star can carve, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Shining through the grape-leaves.

	VI 

Rationalists, wearing square hats, 

Think, in square rooms, 

Looking at the floor, 

Looking at the ceiling. 

They confine themselves 

To right-angled triangles. 

If they tried rhomboids, 

Cones, waving lines, ellipses -


As, for example, the ellipse of the half-moon -


Rationalists would wear sombreros.

Study Of Two Pears 

I 
Opusculum paedagogum. 
The pears are not viols, 
Nudes or bottles. 
They resemble nothing else. 

II 
They are yellow forms 
Composed of curves 
Bulging toward the base. 
They are touched red. 

III 
They are not flat surfaces 
Having curved outlines. 
They are round 
Tapering toward the top. 

IV 
In the way they are modelled 
There are bits of blue. 
A hard dry leaf hangs 
From the stem. 

V 
The yellow glistens. 
It glistens with various yellows, 
Citrons, oranges and greens 
Flowering over the skin. 

VI 
The shadows of the pears 
Are blobs on the green cloth. 
The pears are not seen 
As the observer wills.

Sunday Morning 

1 

Complacencies of the peignoir, and late 
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair, 
And the green freedom of a cockatoo 
Upon a rug mingle to dissipate 
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice. 
She dreams a little, and she feels the dark 
Encroachment of that old catastrophe, 
As a calm darkens among water-lights. 
The pungent oranges and bright, green wings 
Seem things in some procession of the dead, 
Winding across wide water, without sound. 
The day is like wide water, without sound, 
Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet 
Over the seas, to silent Palestine, 
Dominion of the blood and sepulchre. 

2 

Why should she give her bounty to the dead? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
What is divinity if it can come 
Only in silent shadows and in dreams? 
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun, 
In pungent fruit and bright green wings, or else 
In any balm or beauty of the earth, 
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven? 
Divinity must live within herself: 
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow; 
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued 
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty 
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights; 
All pleasures and all pains, remembering 
The bough of summer and the winter branch. 
These are the measure destined for her soul. 

3 

Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth. 



No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave 
Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind. 
He moved among us, as a muttering king, 
Magnificent, would move among his hinds, 
Until our blood, commingling, virginal, 
With heaven, brought such requital to desire 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The very hinds discerned it, in a star. 
Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be 
The blood of paradise? And shall the earth 
Seem all of paradise that we shall know? 
The sky will be much friendlier then than now, 
A part of labor and a part of pain, 
And next in glory to enduring love, 
Not this dividing and indifferent blue. 

4 

She says, 'I am content when wakened birds, 
Before they fly, test the reality 
Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings; 
But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields 
Return no more, where, then, is paradise?' 
There is not any haunt of prophecy, 
Nor any old chimera of the grave, 
Neither the golden underground, nor isle 
Melodious, where spirits gat them home, 
Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm 
Remote on heaven's hill, that has endured 
As April's green endures; or will endure 
Like her remembrance of awakened birds, 
Or her desire for June and evening, tipped 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
By the consummation of the swallow's wings. 

5 

She says, 'But in contentment I still feel 
The need of some imperishable bliss.' 
Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her, 
Alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreams 
And our desires. Although she strews the leaves 
Of sure obliteration on our paths, 
The path sick sorrow took, the many paths 



Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love 
Whispered a little out of tenderness, 
She makes the willow shiver in the sun 
For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze 
Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet. 
She causes boys to pile new plums and pears 
On disregarded plate. The maidens taste 
And stray impassioned in the littering leaves. 

6 

Is there no change of death in paradise? 
Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs 
Hang always heavy in that perfect sky, 
Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
With rivers like our own that seek for seas 
They never find, the same receding shores 
That never touch with inarticulate pang? 
Why set pear upon those river-banks 
Or spice the shores with odors of the plum? 
Alas, that they should wear our colors there, 
The silken weavings of our afternoons, 
And pick the strings of our insipid lutes! 
Death is the mother of beauty, mystical, 
Within whose burning bosom we devise 
Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly. 

7 

Supple and turbulent, a ring of men 
Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn 
Their boisterous devotion to the sun, 
Not as a god, but as a god might be, 
Naked among them, like a savage source. 
Their chant shall be a chant of paradise, 
Out of their blood, returning to the sky; 
And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice, 
The windy lake wherein their lord delights, 
The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills, 
That choir among themselves long afterward. 
They shall know well the heavenly fellowship 
Of men that perish and of summer morn. 



And whence they came and whither they shall go 
The dew upon their feet shall manifest. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

8 

She hears, upon that water without sound, 
A voice that cries, 'The tomb in Palestine 
Is not the porch of spirits lingering. 
It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.' 
We live in an old chaos of the sun, 
Or old dependency of day and night, 
Or island solitude, unsponsored, free, 
Of that wide water, inescapable. 
Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail 
Whistle about us their spontaneous cries; 
Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness; 
And, in the isolation of the sky, 
At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make 
Ambiguous undulations as they sink, 
Downward to darkness, on extended wings. 




Table Talk 

Granted, we die for good. 
Life, then, is largely a thing 
Of happens to like, not should. 

And that, too, granted, why 
Do I happen to like red bush, 
Grey grass and green-gray sky? 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
What else remains? But red, 
Gray, green, why those of all? 
That is not what I said: 

Not those of all. But those. 
One likes what one happens to like. 
One likes the way red grows. 

It cannot matter at all. 
Happens to like is one 
Of the ways things happen to fall. 




Tattoo 

The light is like a spider. 
It crawls over the water. 
It crawls over the edges of the snow. 
It crawls under your eyelids 
And spreads its webs there-Its 
two webs. 

The webs of your eyes 
Are fastened 
To the flesh and bones of you 
As to rafters or grass. 

There are filaments of your eyes 
On the surface of the water 
And in the edges of the snow. 




Tea At The Palaz Of Hoon 

Not less because in purple I descended 
The western day through what you called 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The loneliest air, not less was I myself. 

What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard? 
What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears? 
What was the sea whose tide swept through me there? 

Out of my mind the golden ointment rained, 
And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard. 
I was myself the compass of that sea: 

I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw 
Or heard or felt came not but from myself; 
And there I found myself more truly and more strange. 




The Auroras of Autumn 

This is where the serpent lives, the bodiless. 
His head is air. Beneath his tip at night 
Eyes open and fix on us in every sky. 

Or is this another wriggling out of the egg, 
Another image at the end of the cave, 
Another bodiless for the body's slough? 

This is where the serpent lives. This is his nest, 
These fields, these hills, these tinted distances, 
And the pines above and along and beside the sea. 

This is form gulping after formlessness, 
Skin flashing to wished-for disappearances 
And the serpent body flashing without the skin. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

This is the height emerging and its base 
These lights may finally attain a pole 
In the midmost midnight and find the serpent there, 

In another nest, the master of the maze 
Of body and air and forms and images, 
Relentlessly in possession of happiness. 

This is his poison: that we should disbelieve 
Even that. His meditations in the ferns, 
When he moved so slightly to make sure of sun, 

Made us no less as sure. We saw in his head, 
Black beaded on the rock, the flecked animal, 
The moving grass, the Indian in his glade. 

II 

Farewell to an idea . . . A cabin stands, 
Deserted, on a beach. It is white, 
As by a custom or according to 

An ancestral theme or as a consequence 



Of an infinite course. The flowers against the wall 
Are white, a little dried, a kind of mark 

Reminding, trying to remind, of a white 
That was different, something else, last year 
Or before, not the white of an aging afternoon, 

Whether fresher or duller, whether of winter cloud 
Or of winter sky, from horizon to horizon. 
The wind is blowing the sand across the floor. 

Here, being visible is being white, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Is being of the solid of white, the accomplishment 
Of an extremist in an exercise . . . 

The season changes. A cold wind chills the beach. 
The long lines of it grow longer, emptier, 
A darkness gathers though it does not fall 

And the whiteness grows less vivid on the wall. 
The man who is walking turns blankly on the sand. 
He observes how the north is always enlarging the change, 

With its frigid brilliances, its blue-red sweeps 
And gusts of great enkindlings, its polar green, 
The color of ice and fire and solitude. 

III 

Farewell to an idea . . . The mother's face, 
The purpose of the poem, fills the room. 
They are together, here, and it is warm, 

With none of the prescience of oncoming dreams. 
It is evening. The house is evening, half dissolved. 
Only the half they can never possess remains, 

Still-starred. It is the mother they possess, 
Who gives transparence to their present peace. 
She makes that gentler that can gentle be. 

And yet she too is dissolved, she is destroyed. 



She gives transparence. But she has grown old. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The necklace is a carving not a kiss. 

The soft hands are a motion not a touch. 
The house will crumble and the books will burn. 
They are at ease in a shelter of the mind 

And the house is of the mind and they and time, 
Together, all together. Boreal night 
Will look like frost as it approaches them 

And to the mother as she falls asleep 
And as they say good-night, good-night. Upstairs 
The windows will be lighted, not the rooms. 

A wind will spread its windy grandeurs round 
And knock like a rifle-butt against the door. 
The wind will command them with invincible sound. 

IV 

Farewell to an idea . . . The cancellings, 
The negations are never final. The father sits 
In space, wherever he sits, of bleak regard, 

As one that is strong in the bushes of his eyes. 
He says no to no and yes to yes. He says yes 
To no; and in saying yes he says farewell. 

He measures the velocities of change. 
He leaps from heaven to heaven more rapidly 
Than bad angels leap from heaven to hell in flames. 

But now he sits in quiet and green-a-day. 
He assumes the great speeds of space and flutters them 
From cloud to cloudless, cloudless to keen clear 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In flights of eye and ear, the highest eye 
And the lowest ear, the deep ear that discerns, 
At evening, things that attend it until it hears 

The supernatural preludes of its own, 



At the moment when the angelic eye defines 
Its actors approaching, in company, in their masks. 

Master O master seated by the fire 
And yet in space and motionless and yet 
Of motion the ever-brightening origin, 

Profound, and yet the king and yet the crown, 
Look at this present throne. What company, 
In masks, can choir it with the naked wind? 

V 

The mother invites humanity to her house 
And table. The father fetches tellers of tales 
And musicians who mute much, muse much, on the tales. 

The father fetches negresses to dance, 
Among the children, like curious ripenesses 
Of pattern in the dance's ripening. 

For these the musicians make insidious tones, 
Clawing the sing-song of their instruments. 
The children laugh and jangle a tinny time. 

The father fetches pageants out of air, 
Scenes of the theatre, vistas and blocks of woods 
And curtains like a naive pretence of sleep. 

Among these the musicians strike the instinctive poem. 
The father fetches his unherded herds, 
Of barbarous tongue, slavered and panting halves 

Of breath, obedient to his trumpet's touch. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
This then is Chatillon or as you please. 
We stand in the tumult of a festival. 

What festival? This loud, disordered mooch? 
These hospitaliers? These brute-like guests? 
These musicians dubbing at a tragedy, 

A-dub, a-dub, which is made up of this: 



That there are no lines to speak? There is no play. 
Or, the persons act one merely by being here. 

VI 

It is a theatre floating through the clouds, 
Itself a cloud, although of misted rock 
And mountains running like water, wave on wave, 

Through waves of light. It is of cloud transformed 
To cloud transformed again, idly, the way 
A season changes color to no end, 

Except the lavishing of itself in change, 
As light changes yellow into gold and gold 
To its opal elements and fire's delight, 

Splashed wide-wise because it likes magnificence 
And the solemn pleasures of magnificent space 
The cloud drifts idly through half-thought-of forms. 

The theatre is filled with flying birds, 
Wild wedges, as of a volcano's smoke, palm-eyed 
And vanishing, a web in a corridor 

Or massive portico. A capitol, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
It may be, is emerging or has just 
Collapsed. The denouement has to be postponed . . . 

This is nothing until in a single man contained, 
Nothing until this named thing nameless is 
And is destroyed. He opens the door of his house 

On flames. The scholar of one candle sees 
An Arctic effulgence flaring on the frame 
Of everything he is. And he feels afraid. 

VII 

Is there an imagination that sits enthroned 
As grim as it is benevolent, the just 
And the unjust, which in the midst of summer stops 



To imagine winter? When the leaves are dead, 
Does it take its place in the north and enfold itself, 
Goat-leaper, crystalled and luminous, sitting 

In highest night? And do these heavens adorn 
And proclaim it, the white creator of black, jetted 
By extinguishings, even of planets as may be, 

Even of earth, even of sight, in snow, 
Except as needed by way of majesty, 
In the sky, as crown and diamond cabala? 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
It leaps through us, through all our heavens leaps, 
Extinguishing our planets, one by one, 
Leaving, of where we were and looked, of where 

We knew each other and of each other thought, 
A shivering residue, chilled and foregone, 
Except for that crown and mystical cabala. 

But it dare not leap by chance in its own dark. 
It must change from destiny to slight caprice. 
And thus its jetted tragedy, its stele 

And shape and mournful making move to find 
What must unmake it and, at last, what can, 
Say, a flippant communication under the moon. 

VIII 

There may be always a time of innocence. 
There is never a place. Or if there is no time, 
If it is not a thing of time, nor of place, 

Existing in the idea of it, alone, 
In the sense against calamity, it is not 
Less real. For the oldest and coldest philosopher, 

There is or may be a time of innocence 
As pure principle. Its nature is its end, 
That it should be, and yet not be, a thing 



That pinches the pity of the pitiful man, 
Like a book at evening beautiful but untrue, 
Like a book on rising beautiful and true. 

It is like a thing of ether that exists 
Almost as predicate. But it exists, 
It exists, it is visible, it is, it is. 

So, then, these lights are not a spell of light, 
A saying out of a cloud, but innocence. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
An innocence of the earth and no false sign 

Or symbol of malice. That we partake thereof, 
Lie down like children in this holiness, 
As if, awake, we lay in the quiet of sleep, 

As if the innocent mother sang in the dark 
Of the room and on an accordion, half-heard, 
Created the time and place in which we breathed . . . 

IX 

And of each other thought—in the idiom 
Of the work, in the idiom of an innocent earth, 
Not of the enigma of the guilty dream. 

We were as Danes in Denmark all day long 
And knew each other well, hale-hearted landsmen, 
For whom the outlandish was another day 

Of the week, queerer than Sunday. We thought alike 
And that made brothers of us in a home 
In which we fed on being brothers, fed 

And fattened as on a decorous honeycomb. 
This drama that we live—We lay sticky with sleep. 
This sense of the activity of fate— 

The rendezvous, when she came alone, 
By her coming became a freedom of the two, 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
An isolation which only the two could share. 

Shall we be found hanging in the trees next spring? 
Of what disaster in this the imminence: 
Bare limbs, bare trees and a wind as sharp as salt? 

The stars are putting on their glittering belts. 
They throw around their shoulders cloaks that flash 
Like a great shadow's last embellishment. 

It may come tomorrow in the simplest word, 
Almost as part of innocence, almost, 
Almost as the tenderest and the truest part.

An unhappy people in a happy world— 
Read, rabbi, the phases of this difference. 
An unhappy people in an unhappy world— 

Here are too many mirrors for misery. 
A happy people in an unhappy world— 
It cannot be. There's nothing there to roll 

On the expressive tongue, the finding fang. 
A happy people in a happy world— 
Buffo! A ball, an opera, a bar. 

Turn back to where we were when we began: 
An unhappy people in a happy world. 
Now, solemnize the secretive syllables. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Read to the congregation, for today 
And for tomorrow, this extremity, 
This contrivance of the spectre of the spheres, 

Contriving balance to contrive a whole, 
The vital, the never-failing genius, 
Fulfilling his meditations, great and small. 

In these unhappy he meditates a whole, 
The full of fortune and the full of fate, 



As if he lived all lives, that he might know, 

In hall harridan, not hushful paradise, 
To a haggling of wind and weather, by these lights 
Like a blaze of summer straw, in winter's nick. 




The Death Of A Soldier 

Life contracts and death is expected, 
As in season of autumn. 
The soldier falls. 

He does not become a three-days personage. 
Imposing his separation, 
Calling for pomp. 

Death is absolute and without memorial, 
As in a season of autumn, 
When the wind stops, 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
When the wind stops and, over the heavens, 
The clouds go, nevertheless, 
In their direction. 




The Emperor Of Ice-Cream 

Call the roller of big cigars, 
The muscular one, and bid him whip 
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds. 
Let the wenches dawdle in such dress 
As they are used to wear, and let the boys 
Bring flowers in last month's newspapers. 
Let be be finale of seem. 
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream. 

Take from the dresser of deal. 
Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheet 
On which she embroidered fantails once 
And spread it so as to cover her face. 
If her horny feet protrude, they come 
To show how cold she is, and dumb. 
Let the lamp affix its beam. 
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream. 




The High-Toned Old Christian Woman 

Poetry is the supreme fiction, madame. 
Take the moral law and make a nave of it 
And from the nave build haunted , 
The conscience is converted into palms, 
Like windy citherns hankering for hymns. 
We agree in 's take 
The opposing law and make a peristyle, 
And from the peristyle project a masque 
Beyond the , our bawdiness, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Unpurged by epitaph, indulged at last, 
Is equally converted into palms, 
Squiggling like palm for palm, 
Madame, we are where we , 
Therefore, that in the planetary scene 
Your disaffected flagellants, well-stuffed, 
Smacking their muzzy bellies in parade, 
Proud of such novelties of the sublime, 
Such tink and tank and tunk-a-tunk-tunk, 
May, merely may, madame, whip from themselves 
A jovial hullabaloo among the spheres. 
This will make widows fictive things 
Wink as they most when widows wince. 




The House Was Quiet And The World Was Calm 

The house was quiet and the world was calm. 
The reader became the book; and summer night 

Was like the conscious being of the book. 
The house was quiet and the world was calm. 

The words were spoken as if there was no book, 
Except that the reader leaned above the page, 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Wanted to lean, wanted much to be 
The scholar to whom his book is true, to whom 

The summer night is like a perfection of thought. 
The house was quiet because it had to be. 

The quiet was part of the meaning, part of the mind: 
The access of perfection to the page. 

And the world was calm. The truth in a calm world, 
In which there is no other meaning, itself 

Is calm, itself is summer and night, itself 
Is the reader leaning late and reading there. 




The Idea Of Order At Key West 

She sang beyond the genius of the sea. 
The water never formed to mind or voice, 
Like a body wholly body, fluttering 
Its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion 
Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry, 
That was not ours although we understood, 
Inhuman, of the veritable ocean. 

The sea was not a mask. No more was she. 
The song and water were not medleyed sound 
Even if what she sang was what she heard, 
Since what she sang was uttered word by word. 
It may be that in all her phrases stirred 
The grinding water and the gasping wind; 
But it was she and not the sea we heard. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
For she was the maker of the song she sang. 
The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea 
Was merely a place by which she walked to sing. 
Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew 
It was the spirit that we sought and knew 
That we should ask this often as she sang. 

If it was only the dark voice of the sea 
That rose, or even colored by many waves; 
If it was only the outer voice of sky 
And cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled, 
However clear, it would have been deep air, 
The heaving speech of air, a summer sound 
Repeated in a summer without end 
And sound alone. But it was more than that, 
More even than her voice, and ours, among 
The meaningless plungings of water and the wind, 
Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped 
On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres 
Of sky and sea. 
It was her voice that made 
The sky acutest at its vanishing. 
She measured to the hour its solitude. 



She was the single artificer of the world 
In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea, 
Whatever self it had, became the self 
That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
As we beheld her striding there alone, 
Knew that there was never a world for her 
Except the one she sang and, singing, made. 

Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know, 
Why, when the singing ended and we turned 
Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights, 
The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there, 
As the night descended, tilting in the air, 
Mastered the night and portioned out the sea, 
Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles, 
Arranging, deepening, enchanting night. 

Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon, 
The maker's rage to order words of sea 
Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred, 
And of ourselves and our origins, 
In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds. 




The Man On The Dump 

Day creeps down. The moon is creeping up. 
The sun is a corbeil of flowers the moon Blanche 
Places there, a bouquet. Ho-ho…The dump is full 
Of images. Days pass like papers from a press. 
The bouquets come here in the papers. So the sun, 
And so the moon, both come, and the janitor's poems 
Of every day, the wrapper on the can of pears, 
The cat in the paper-bag, the corset, the box 
From Esthonia: the tiger chest, for tea. 

The freshness of night has been fresh a long time. 
The freshness of morning, the blowing of day, one says 
That it puffs as Cornelius Nepos reads, it puffs 
More than, less than or it puffs like this or that. 
The green smacks in the eye, the dew in the green 
Smacks like fresh water in a can, like the sea 
On a cocoanut—how many men have copied dew 
For buttons, how many women have covered themselves 
With dew, dew dresses, stones and chains of dew, heads 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of the floweriest flowers dewed with the dewiest dew. 
One grows to hate these things except on the dump. 

Now in the time of spring (azaleas, trilliums, 
Myrtle, viburnums, daffodils, blue phlox) , 
Between that disgust and this, between the things 
That are on the dump (azaleas and so on) 
And those that will be (azaleas and so on) , 
One feels the purifying change. One rejects 
The trash.

 That's the moment when the moon creeps up 
To the bubbling of bassoons. That's the time 
One looks at the elephant-colorings of tires. 
Everything is shed; and the moon comes up as the moon 
(All its images are in the dump) and you see 
As a man (not like an image of a man) , 
You see the moon rise in the empty sky. 

One sits and beats an old tin can, lard pail. 



One beats and beats for that which one believes. 
That's what one wants to get near. Could it after all 
Be merely oneself, as superior as the ear 
To a crow's voice? Did the nightingale torture the ear, 
Pack the heart and scratch the mind? And does the ear 
Solace itself in peevish birds? Is it peace, 
Is it a philosopher's honeymoon, one finds 
On the dump? Is it to sit among mattresses of the dead, 
Bottles, pots, shoes, and grass and murmur aptest eve: 
Is it to hear the blatter of grackles and say 
Invisible priest; is it to eject, to pull 
The day to pieces and cry stanza my stone? 
Where was it one first heard of the truth? The the. 




The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad 

The time of year has grown indifferent. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Mildew of summer and the deepening snow 
Are both alike in the routine I know: 
I am too dumbly in my being pent. 

The wind attendant on the solstices 
Blows on the shutters of the metropoles, 
Stirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls 
The grand ideas of the villages. 

The malady of the quotidian . . . 
Perhaps if summer ever came to rest 
And lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed 
Through days like oceans in obsidian 

Horizons, full of night's midsummer blaze; 
Perhaps, if winter once could penetrate 
Through all its purples to the final slate, 
Persisting bleakly in an icy haze; 

One might in turn become less diffident, 
Out of such mildew plucking neater mould 
And spouting new orations of the cold. 
One might. One might. But time will not relent. 




The Man With The Blue Guitar 

The man bent over his guitar, 
A shearsman of sorts. The day was green. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
They said, 'You have a blue guitar, 
You do not play things as they are.' 

The man replied, 'Things as they are 
Are changed upon the blue guitar.' 

And they said then, 'But play, you must, 
A tune beyond us, yet ourselves, 

A tune upon the blue guitar 
Of things exactly as they are.' 

II 
I cannot bring a world quite round, 
Although I patch it as I can. 

I sing a hero's head, large eye 
And bearded bronze, but not a man, 

Although I patch him as I can 
And reach through him almost to man. 

If to serenade almost to man 
Is to miss, by that, things as they are, 

Say it is the serenade 
Of a man that plays a blue guitar. 

III 
Ah, but to play man number one, 
To drive the dagger in his heart, 

To lay his brain upon the board 
And pick the acrid colors out, 

To nail his thought across the door, 



Its wings spread wide to rain and snow, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

To strike his living hi and ho, 
To tick it, tock it, turn it true, 

To bang from it a savage blue, 
Jangling the metal of the strings 

IV 
So that's life, then: things as they are? 
It picks its way on the blue guitar. 

A million people on one string? 
And all their manner in the thing, 

And all their manner, right and wrong, 
And all their manner, weak and strong? 

The feelings crazily, craftily call, 
Like a buzzing of flies in autumn air, 

And that's life, then: things as they are, 
This buzzing of the blue guitar. 

V 
Do not speak to us of the greatness of poetry, 
Of the torches wisping in the underground, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Of the structure of vaults upon a point of light. 
There are no shadows in our sun, 

Day is desire and night is sleep. 
There are no shadows anywhere. 

The earth, for us, is flat and bare. 
There are no shadows. Poetry 

Exceeding music must take the place 
Of empty heaven and its hymns, 

Ourselves in poetry must take their place, 
Even in the chattering of your guitar. 



VI 
A tune beyond us as we are, 
Yet nothing changed by the blue guitar; 

Ourselves in the tune as if in space, 
Yet nothing changed, except the place 

Of things as they are and only the place 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
As you play them, on the blue guitar, 

Placed, so, beyond the compass of change, 
Perceived in a final atmosphere; 

For a moment final, in the way 
The thinking of art seems final when 

The thinking of god is smoky dew. 
The tune is space. The blue guitar 

Becomes the place of things as they are, 
A composing of senses of the guitar. 

VII 
It is the sun that shares our works. 
The moon shares nothing. It is a sea. 

When shall I come to say of the sun, 
It is a sea; it shares nothing; 

The sun no longer shares our works 
And the earth is alive with creeping men, 

Mechanical beetles never quite warm? 
And shall I then stand in the sun, as now 

I stand in the moon, and call it good, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The immaculate, the merciful good, 

Detached from us, from things as they are? 
Not to be part of the sun? To stand 



Remote and call it merciful? 
The strings are cold on the blue guitar. 

VIII 
The vivid, florid, turgid sky, 
The drenching thunder rolling by, 

The morning deluged still by night, 
The clouds tumultuously bright 

And the feeling heavy in cold chords 
Struggling toward impassioned choirs, 

Crying among the clouds, enraged 
By gold antagonists in air-

I know my lazy, leaden twang 
Is like the reason in a storm; 

And yet it brings the storm to bear. 
I twang it out and leave it there. 

IX 
And the color, the overcast blue 
Of the air, in which the blue guitar 

Is a form, described but difficult, 
And I am merely a shadow hunched 

Above the arrowy, still strings, 
The maker of a thing yet to be made; 

The color like a thought that grows 
Out of a mood, the tragic robe 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of the actor, half his gesture, half 
His speech, the dress of his meaning, silk 

Sodden with his melancholy words, 
The weather of his stage, himself. 

X 



Raise reddest columns. Toll a bell 
And clap the hollows full of tin. 

Throw papers in the streets, the wills 
Of the dead, majestic in their seals. 

And the beautiful trombones-behold 
The approach of him whom none believes, 

Whom all believe that all believe, 
A pagan in a varnished care. 

Roll a drum upon the blue guitar. 
Lean from the steeple. Cry aloud, 

'Here am I, my adversary, that 
Confront you, hoo-ing the slick trombones, 

Yet with a petty misery 
At heart, a petty misery, 

Ever the prelude to your end, 
The touch that topples men and rock.' 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

XV 
Is this picture of Picasso's, this 'hoard 
Of destructions', a picture of ourselves, 

Now, an image of our society? 
Do I sit, deformed, a naked egg, 

Catching at Good-bye, harvest moon, 
Without seeing the harvest or the moon? 

Things as they are have been destroyed. 
Have I? Am I a man that is dead 

At a table on which the food is cold? 
Is my thought a memory, not alive? 

Is the spot on the floor, there, wine or blood 
And whichever it may be, is it mine? 



XXIII 
A few final solutions, like a duet 
With the undertaker: a voice in the clouds, 

Another on earth, the one a voice 
Of ether, the other smelling of drink, 

The voice of ether prevailing, the swell 
Of the undertaker's song in the snow 

Apostrophizing wreaths, the voice 
In the clouds serene and final, next 

The grunted breath scene and final, 
The imagined and the real, thought 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the truth, Dichtung und Wahrheit, all 
Confusion solved, as in a refrain 

One keeps on playing year by year, 
Concerning the nature of things as they are. 

XXX 
From this I shall evolve a man. 
This is his essence: the old fantoche 

Hanging his shawl upon the wind, 
Like something on the stage, puffed out, 

His strutting studied through centuries. 
At last, in spite of his manner, his eye 

A-cock at the cross-piece on a pole 
Supporting heavy cables, slung 

Through Oxidia, banal suburb, 
One-half of all its installments paid. 

Dew-dapper clapper-traps, blazing 
From crusty stacks above machines. 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Ecce, Oxidia is the seed 
Dropped out of this amber-ember pod, 

Oxidia is the soot of fire, 
Oxidia is Olympia. 

XXXI 
How long and late the pheasant sleeps 
The employer and employee contend, 

Combat, compose their droll affair. 
The bubbling sun will bubble up, 

Spring sparkle and the cock-bird shriek. 
The employer and employee will hear 

And continue their affair. The shriek 
Will rack the thickets. There is no place, 

Here, for the lark fixed in the mind, 
In the museum of the sky. The cock 

Will claw sleep. Morning is not sun, 
It is this posture of the nerves, 

As if a blunted player clutched 
The nuances of the blue guitar. 

It must be this rhapsody or none, 
The rhapsody of things as they are. 

XXXII 
Throw away the lights, the definitions, 
And say of what you see in the dark 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

That it is this or that it is that, 
But do not use the rotted names. 

How should you walk in that space and know 
Nothing of the madness of space, 

Nothing of its jocular procreations? 



Throw the lights away. Nothing must stand 

Between you and the shapes you take 
When the crust of shape has been destroyed. 

You as you are? You are yourself. 
The blue guitar surprises you. 

XXXIII 
That generation's dream, aviled 
In the mud, in Monday's dirty light, 

That's it, the only dream they knew, 
Time in its final block, not time 

To come, a wrangling of two dreams. 
Here is the bread of time to come, 

Here is its actual stone. The bread 
Will be our bread, the stone will be 

Our bed and we shall sleep by night. 
We shall forget by day, except 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The moments when we choose to play 
The imagined pine, the imagined jay. 




The Planet On The Table 

Ariel was glad he had written his poems. 
They were of a remembered time 
Or of something seen that he liked. 

Other makings of the sun 
Were waste and welter 
And the ripe shrub writhed. 

His self and the sun were one 
And his poems, although makings of his self, 
Were no less makings of the sun. 

It was not important that they survive. 
What mattered was that they should bear 
Some lineament or character, 

Some affluence, if only half-perceived, 
In the poverty of their words, 
Of the planet of which they were part.

The Plot Against The Giant 

<i>First Girl</i> 
When this yokel comes maundering, 
Whetting his hacker, 
I shall run before him, 
Diffusing the civilest odors 
Out of geraniums and unsmelled flowers. 
It will check him. 

<i>Second Girl</i> 
I shall run before him, 
Arching cloths besprinkled with colors 
As small as fish-eggs. 
The threads 
Will abash him. 

<i>Third Girl</i> 
Oh, la...le pauvre! 
I shall run before him, 
With a curious puffing. 
He will bend his ear then. 
I shall whisper 
Heavenly labials in a world of gutturals. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
It will undo him. 




The Poem That Took The Place Of A Mountain 

There it was, word for word, 
The poem that took the place of a mountain. 

He breathed its oxygen, 
Even when the book lay turned in the dust of his table. 

It reminded him how he had needed 
A place to go to in his own direction, 

How he had recomposed the pines, 
Shifted the rocks and picked his way among clouds, 

For the outlook that would be right, 
Where he would be complete in an unexplained completion: 

The exact rock where his inexactness 
Would discover, at last, the view toward which they had edged, 

Where he could lie and, gazing down at the sea, 
Recognize his unique and solitary home. 




The River Of Rivers In Connecticut 

There is a great river this side of Stygia 
Before one comes to the first black cataracts 
And trees that lack the intelligence of trees. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In that river, far this side of Stygia, 
The mere flowing of the water is a gayety, 
Flashing and flashing in the sun. On its banks, 

No shadow walks. The river is fateful, 
Like the last one. But there is no ferryman. 
He could not bend against its propelling force. 

It is not to be seen beneath the appearances 
That tell of it. The steeple at Farmington 
Stands glistening and Haddam shines and sways. 

It is the third commonness with light and air, 
A curriculum, a vigor, a local abstraction . . . 
Call it, one more, a river, an unnamed flowing, 

Space-filled, reflecting the seasons, the folk-lore 
Of each of the senses; call it, again and again, 
The river that flows nowhere, like a sea. 




The Sense Of The Sleight-Of-Hand Man 

One's grand flights, one's Sunday baths, 
One's tootings at the weddings of the soul 
Occur as they occur. So bluish clouds 
Occurred above the empty house and the leaves 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of the rhododendrons rattled their gold, 
As if someone lived there. Such floods of white 
Came bursting from the clouds. So the wind 
Threw its contorted strength around the sky. 

Could you have said the bluejay suddenly 
Would swoop to earth? It is a wheel, the rays 
Around the sun. The wheel survives the myths. 
The fire eye in the clouds survives the gods. 
To think of a dove with an eye of grenadine 
And pines that are cornets, so it occurs, 
And a little island full of geese and stars: 
It may be the ignorant man, alone, 
Has any chance to mate his life with life 
That is the sensual, pearly spuse, the life 
That is fluent in even the wintriest bronze. 




The Snow Man 

One must have a mind of winter 
To regard the frost and the boughs 
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow; 

And have been cold a long time 
To behold the junipers shagged with ice, 
The spruces rough in the distant glitter 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of the January sun; and not to think 
Of any misery in the sound of the wind, 
In the sound of a few leaves, 

Which is the sound of the land 
Full of the same wind 
That is blowing in the same bare place 
For the listener, who listens in the snow, 
And, nothing himself, beholds 
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. 




The Well Dressed Man With A Beard 

After the final no there comes a yes 
And on that yes the future world depends. 
No was the night. Yes is this present sun. 
If the rejected things, the things denied, 
Slid over the western cataract, yet one, 
One only, one thing that was firm, even 
No greater than a cricket's horn, no more 
Than a thought to be rehearsed all day, a speech 
Of the self that must sustain itself on speech, 
One thing remaining, infallible, would be 
Enough. Ah! douce campagna of that thing! 
Ah! douce campagna, honey in the heart, 
Green in the body, out of a petty phrase, 
Out of a thing believed, a thing affirmed: 
The form on the pillow humming while one sleeps, 
The aureole above the humming house... 
It can never be satisfied, the mind, never. 




Thirteen Ways Of Looking At A Blackbird 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I 

Among twenty snowy mountains, 
The only moving thing 
Was the eye of the black bird. 

II 

I was of three minds, 
Like a tree 
In which there are three blackbirds. 

III 

The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds. 
It was a small part of the pantomime. 

IV 

A man and a woman 
Are one. 
A man and a woman and a blackbird 
Are one. 

V 

I do not know which to prefer, 
The beauty of inflections 
Or the beauty of innuendoes, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The blackbird whistling 
Or just after. 

VI 

Icicles filled the long window 
With barbaric glass. 
The shadow of the blackbird 
Crossed it, to and fro. 
The mood 



Traced in the shadow 
An indecipherable cause. 

VII 

O thin men of Haddam, 
Why do you imagine golden birds? 
Do you not see how the blackbird 
Walks around the feet 
Of the women about you? 

VIII 

I know noble accents 
And lucid, inescapable rhythms; 
But I know, too, 
That the blackbird is involved 
In what I know. 

IX 

When the blackbird flew out of sight, 
It marked the edge 
Of one of many circles. 

X 

At the sight of blackbirds 
Flying in a green light, 
Even the bawds of euphony 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Would cry out sharply. 

XI 

He rode over Connecticut 
In a glass coach. 
Once, a fear pierced him, 
In that he mistook 
The shadow of his equipage 
For blackbirds. 

XII 



The river is moving. 
The blackbird must be flying. 

XIII 

It was evening all afternoon. 
It was snowing 
And it was going to snow. 
The blackbird sat 
In the cedar-limbs. 




To The One Of Fictive Music 

Sister and mother and diviner love, 
And of the sisterhood of the living dead 
Most near, most clear, and of the clearest bloom, 
And of the fragrant mothers the most dear 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And queen, and of diviner love the day 
And flame and summer and sweet fire, no thread 
Of cloudy silver sprinkles in your gown 
Its venom of renown, and on your head 
No crown is simpler than the simple hair. 

Now, of the music summoned by the birth 
That separates us from the wind and sea, 
Yet leaves us in them, until earth becomes, 
By being so much of the things we are, 
Gross effigy and simulacrum, none 
Gives motion to perfection more serene 
Than yours, out of our own imperfections wrought, 
Most rare, or ever of more kindred air 
In the laborious weaving that you wear. 

For so retentive of themselves are men 
That music is intensest which proclaims 
The near, the clear, and vaunts the clearest bloom, 
And of all the vigils musing the obscure, 
That apprehends the most which sees and names, 
As in your name, an image that is sure, 
Among the arrant spices of the sun, 
O bough and bush and scented vine, in whom 
We give ourselves our likest issuance. 

Yet not too like, yet not so like to be 
Too near, too clear, saving a little to endow 
Our feigning with the strange unlike, whence springs 
The difference that heavenly pity brings. 
For this, musician, in your girdle fixed 
Bear other perfumes. On your pale head wear 
A band entwining, set with fatal stones. 
Unreal, give back to us what once you gave: 
The imagination that we spurned and crave.

Two Figures In Dense Violet Light 

I had as lief be embraced by the portier of the hotel 
As to get no more from the moonlight 
Than your moist hand. 

Be the voice of the night and Florida in my ear. 
Use dasky words and dusky images. 
Darken your speech. 

Speak, even, as if I did not hear you speaking, 
But spoke for you perfectly in my thoughts, 
Conceiving words, 

As the night conceives the sea-sound in silence, 
And out of the droning sibilants makes 
A serenade. 

Say, puerile, that the buzzards crouch on the ridge-pole 
and sleep with one eye watching the stars fall 
Beyond Key West. 

Say that the palms are clear in the total blue. 
Are clear and are obscure; that it is night; 
That the moon shines. 




Valley Candle 

My candle burned alone in an immense valley. 
Beams of the huge night converged upon it, 
Until the wind blew. 
The beams of the huge night 
Converged upon its image, 
Until the wind blew.

What Is Divinity 

What is divinity if it can come 
Only in silent shadows and in dreams? 
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun, 
In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else 
In any balm or beauty of the earth, 
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven? 
Divinity must live within herself: 
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow; 
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued 
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty 
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights; 
All pleasures and all pains, remembering 
The bough of summer and the winter branch, 
These are the measures destined for her soul.
