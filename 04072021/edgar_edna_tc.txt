A Dream 

In visions of the dark night 
I have dreamed of joy departedBut 
a waking dream of life and light 
Hath left me broken-hearted.

 Ah! what is not a dream by day 
To him whose eyes are cast 
On things around him with a ray 
Turned back upon the past?

 That holy dream- that holy dream, 
While all the world were chiding, 
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam

 A lonely spirit guiding.

 What though that light, thro' storm and night, 
So trembled from afarWhat 
could there be more purely bright 
In Truth's day-star?

A Dream Within A Dream 

Take this kiss upon the brow! 
And, in parting from you now, 
Thus much let me avowYou 
are not wrong, who deem 
That my days have been a dream; 
Yet if hope has flown away 
In a night, or in a day, 
In a vision, or in none, 
Is it therefore the less gone? 
All that we see or seem 
Is but a dream within a dream.

 I stand amid the roar 
Of a surf-tormented shore, 
And I hold within my hand 
Grains of the golden sandHow 
few! yet how they creep 
Through my fingers to the deep, 
While I weep- while I weep! 
O God! can I not grasp 
Them with a tighter clasp? 
O God! can I not save 
One from the pitiless wave? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Is all that we see or seem 
But a dream within a dream? 




A Paean 

How shall the burial rite be read? 
The solemn song be sung? 
The requiem for the loveliest dead, 
That ever died so young? 

II. 

Her friends are gazing on her, 
And on her gaudy bier, 
And weep! - oh! to dishonor 
Dead beauty with a tear! 

III. 

They loved her for her wealth And 
they hated her for her pride But 
she grew in feeble health, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And they love her - that she died. 

IV. 

They tell me (while they speak 
Of her 'costly broider'd pall') 
That my voice is growing weak That 
I should not sing at all 


V. 

Or that my tone should be 
Tun'd to such solemn song 
So mournfully - so mournfully, 
That the dead may feel no wrong. 

VI. 

But she is gone above, 
With young Hope at her side, 
And I am drunk with love 
Of the dead, who is my bride. 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


VII. 

Of the dead - dead who lies 
All perfum'd there, 
With the death upon her eyes, 
And the life upon her hair. 

VIII. 

Thus on the coffin loud and long 
I strike - the murmur sent 
Through the grey chambers to my song, 
Shall be the accompaniment. 

IX. 

Thou died'st in thy life's June But 
thou did'st not die too fair: 
Thou did'st not die too soon, 
Nor with too calm an air. 

X. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
From more than fiends on earth, 
Thy life and love are riven, 
To join the untainted mirth 
Of more than thrones in heaven 


XII. 

Therefore, to thee this night 
I will no requiem raise, 
But waft thee on thy flight, 
With a Pæan of old days. 




A Valentine 

For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes, 
Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,

 Shall find her own sweet name, that nestling lies 
Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader. 
Search narrowly the lines! - they hold a treasure

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 Divine- a talisman- an amulet 
That must be worn at heart. Search well the measureThe 
words- the syllables! Do not forget 
The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor 
And yet there is in this no Gordian knot 
Which one might not undo without a sabre, 
If one could merely comprehend the plot. 
Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering 
Eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdus 
Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing 
Of poets, by poets- as the name is a poet's, too, 
Its letters, although naturally lying 
Like the knight Pinto- Mendez FerdinandoStill 
form a synonym for Truth- Cease trying! 
You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do. 




Al Aaraaf 

PART I

 O! nothing earthly save the ray 
(Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
As in those gardens where the day 
Springs from the gems of CircassyO! 
nothing earthly save the thrill 
Of melody in woodland rillOr 
(music of the passion-hearted) 
Joy's voice so peacefully departed 
That like the murmur in the shell, 
Its echo dwelleth and will dwellOh, 
nothing of the dross of oursYet 
all the beauty- all the flowers 
That list our Love, and deck our bowersAdorn 
yon world afar, afarThe 
wandering star.

 'Twas a sweet time for Nesace- for there 
Her world lay lolling on the golden air, 
Near four bright suns- a temporary restAn 
oasis in desert of the blest. 
Away- away- 'mid seas of rays that roll 
Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soulThe 
soul that scarce (the billows are so dense) 
Can struggle to its destin'd eminence,To 
distant spheres, from time to time, she rode 
And late to ours, the favor'd one of GodBut, 
now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
She throws aside the sceptre- leaves the helm, 
And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns, 
Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.

 Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth, 
Whence sprang the 'Idea of Beauty' into birth, 
(Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star, 
Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar, 
It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt) 
She looked into Infinity- and knelt. 



 Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curledFit 
emblems of the model of her worldSeen 
but in beauty- not impeding sight 
Of other beauty glittering thro' the lightA 
wreath that twined each starry form around, 
And all the opal'd air in color bound.

 All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed 
Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head 
On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang 
So eagerly around about to hang 
Upon the flying footsteps of- deep prideOf 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
her who lov'd a mortal- and so died. 
The Sephalica, budding with young bees, 
Upreared its purple stem around her knees:And 
gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'dInmate 
of highest stars, where erst it sham'd 
All other loveliness:- its honied dew 
(The fabled nectar that the heathen knew) 
Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven, 
And fell on gardens of the unforgiven 
In Trebizond- and on a sunny flower 
So like its own above that, to this hour, 
It still remaineth, torturing the bee 
With madness, and unwonted reverie: 
In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf 
And blossom of the fairy plant in grief 
Disconsolate linger- grief that hangs her head, 
Repenting follies that full long have Red, 
Heaving her white breast to the balmy air, 
Like guilty beauty, chasten'd and more fair: 
Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light 
She fears to perfume, perfuming the night: 
And Clytia, pondering between many a sun, 
While pettish tears adown her petals run: 
And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth, 
And died, ere scarce exalted into birth, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing 
Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king: 
And Valisnerian lotus, thither flown' 
From struggling with the waters of the Rhone: 
And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante! 



 Isola d'oro!- Fior di Levante! 
And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever 
With Indian Cupid down the holy riverFair 
flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given 
To bear the Goddess' song, in odors, up to Heaven:

 'Spirit! that dwellest where, 
In the deep sky, 
The terrible and fair, 
In beauty vie! 
Beyond the line of blueThe 
boundary of the star 
Which turneth at the view 
Of thy barrier and thy barOf 
the barrier overgone 
By the comets who were cast 
From their pride and from their throne 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To be drudges till the lastTo 
be carriers of fire 
(The red fire of their heart) 
With speed that may not tire 
And with pain that shall not partWho 
livest- that we knowIn 
Eternity- we feelBut 
the shadow of whose brow 
What spirit shall reveal? 
Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace, 
Thy messenger hath known 
Have dream'd for thy Infinity 
A model of their ownThy 
will is done, O God! 
The star hath ridden high 
Thro' many a tempest, but she rode

 Beneath thy burning eye; 
And here, in thought, to theeIn 
thought that can alone 
Ascend thy empire and so be

 A partner of thy throneBy 
winged Fantasy, 
My embassy is given, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Till secrecy shall knowledge be

 In the environs of Heaven.' 



 She ceas'd- and buried then her burning cheek 
Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek 
A shelter from the fervor of His eye; 
For the stars trembled at the Deity. 
She stirr'd not- breath'd not- for a voice was there 
How solemnly pervading the calm air! 
A sound of silence on the startled ear 
Which dreamy poets name 'the music of the sphere.' 
Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call 
'Silence'- which is the merest word of all. 
All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things 
Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wingsBut 
ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high 
The eternal voice of God is passing by, 
And the red winds are withering in the sky:


'What tho 'in worlds which sightless cycles run, 
Linked to a little system, and one sunWhere 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
all my love is folly and the crowd 
Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud, 
The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath(
Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?) 
What tho' in worlds which own a single sun 
The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run, 
Yet thine is my resplendency, so given 
To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven! 
Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly, 
With all thy train, athwart the moony skyApart- 
like fire-flies in Sicilian night, 
And wing to other worlds another light! 
Divulge the secrets of thy embassy 
To the proud orbs that twinkle- and so be 
To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban 
Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!'

 Up rose the maiden in the yellow night, 
The single-mooned eve!- on Earth we plight 
Our faith to one love- and one moon adoreThe 
birth-place of young Beauty had no more. 
As sprang that yellow star from downy hours 
Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers, 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 And bent o'er sheeny mountains and dim plain 
Her way, but left not yet her Therasaean reign. 

PART II

 High on a mountain of enamell'd headSuch 
as the drowsy shepherd on his bed 
Of giant pasturage lying at his ease, 
Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees 
With many a mutter'd 'hope to be forgiven' 
What time the moon is quadrated in HeavenOf 
rosy head that, towering far away 
Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray 
Of sunken suns at eve- at noon of night, 
While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger lightUprear'd 
upon such height arose a pile 
Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air, 
Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile 
Far down upon the wave that sparkled there, 
And nursled the young mountain in its lair. 
Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall 
Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall 
Of their own dissolution, while they dieAdorning 
then the dwellings of the sky. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down, 
Sat gently on these columns as a crownA 
window of one circular diamond, there, 
Look'd out above into the purple air, 
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain 
And hallow'd all the beauty twice again, 
Save, when, between th' empyrean and that ring, 
Some eager spirit Flapp'd his dusky wing. 
But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen 
The dimness of this world: that greyish green 
That Nature loves the best Beauty's grave 
Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architraveAnd 
every sculptur'd cherub thereabout 
That from his marble dwelling peered out, 
Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his nicheAchaian 
statues in a world so rich! 
Friezes from Tadmor and PersepolisFrom 
Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss 



 Of beautiful Gomorrah! O, the wave 
Is now upon thee- but too late to save!

 Sound loves to revel in a summer night: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Witness the murmur of the grey twilight 
That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco, 
Of many a wild star-gazer long agoThat 
stealeth ever on the ear of him 
Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim, 
And sees the darkness coming as a cloudIs 
not its form- its voice- most palpable and loud?

 But what is this?- it cometh, and it brings 
A music with it- 'tis the rush of wingsA 
pause- and then a sweeping, falling strain 
And Nesace is in her halls again. 
From the wild energy of wanton haste

 Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart; 
And zone that clung around her gentle waist

 Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart. 
Within the centre of that hall to breathe, 
She paused and panted, Zanthe! all beneath, 
The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair 
And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there.

 Young flowers were whispering in melody 
To happy flowers that night- and tree to tree; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Fountains were gushing music as they fell 
In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell; 
Yet silence came upon material thingsFair 
flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wingsAnd 
sound alone that from the spirit sprang 
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:

 ''Neath the blue-bell or streamerOr 
tufted wild spray 
That keeps, from the dreamer, 
The moonbeam awayBright 
beings! that ponder, 
With half closing eyes, 
On the stars which your wonder 
Hath drawn from the skies, 



 Till they glance thro' the shade, and 
Come down to your brow 
Like- eyes of the maiden 
Who calls on you nowArise! 
from your dreaming 
In violet bowers, 
To duty beseeming 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
These star-litten hoursAnd 
shake from your tresses 
Encumber'd with dew 
The breath of those kisses 
That cumber them too(
O! how, without you, Love! 
Could angels be blest?) 
Those kisses of true Love 
That lull'd ye to rest! 
Up!- shake from your wing 
Each hindering thing: 
The dew of the nightIt 
would weigh down your flight 
And true love caressesO, 
leave them apart! 
They are light on the tresses, 
But lead on the heart.

 Ligeia! Ligeia! 
My beautiful one! 
Whose harshest idea 
Will to melody run, 
O! is it thy will 
On the breezes to toss? 
Or, capriciously still, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Like the lone Albatros, 
Incumbent on night 
(As she on the air) 
To keep watch with delight 
On the harmony there?

 Ligeia! wherever 
Thy image may be, 
No magic shall sever 
Thy music from thee. 



 Thou hast bound many eyes 
In a dreamy sleepBut 
the strains still arise 
Which thy vigilance keepThe 
sound of the rain, 
Which leaps down to the flowerAnd 
dances again 
In the rhythm of the showerThe 
murmur that springs 
From the growing of grass 
Are the music of thingsBut 
are modell'd, alas!Away, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
then, my dearest, 
Oh! hie thee away 
To the springs that lie clearest 
Beneath the moon-rayTo 
lone lake that smiles, 
In its dream of deep rest, 
At the many star-isles 
That enjewel its breastWhere 
wild flowers, creeping, 
Have mingled their shade, 
On its margin is sleeping 
Full many a maidSome 
have left the cool glade, and 
Have slept with the beeArouse 
them, my maiden, 
On moorland and leaGo! 
breathe on their slumber, 
All softly in ear, 
Thy musical number 
They slumbered to hearFor 
what can awaken 
An angel so soon, 
Whose sleep hath been taken 
Beneath the cold moon, 
As the spell which no slumber 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of witchery may test, 
The rhythmical number 
Which lull'd him to rest?'

 Spirits in wing, and angels to the view, 



 A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro', 
Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flightSeraphs 
in all but 'Knowledge,' the keen light 
That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds, afar, 
O Death! from eye of God upon that star: 
Sweet was that error- sweeter still that deathSweet 
was that error- even with us the breath 
Of Science dims the mirror of our joyTo 
them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroyFor 
what (to them) availeth it to know 
That Truth is Falsehood- or that Bliss is Woe? 
Sweet was their death- with them to die was rife 
With the last ecstasy of satiate lifeBeyond 
that death no immortalityBut 
sleep that pondereth and is not 'to be'!And 
there- oh! may my weary spirit dwellApart 
from Heaven's Eternity- and yet how far from Hell! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim, 
Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn? 
But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts 
To those who hear not for their beating hearts. 
A maiden-angel and her seraph-loverO! 
where (and ye may seek the wide skies over) 
Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known? 
Unguided Love hath fallen- 'mid 'tears of perfect moan.' 
He was a goodly spirit- he who fell: 
A wanderer by moss-y-mantled wellA 
gazer on the lights that shine aboveA 
dreamer in the moonbeam by his love: 
What wonder? for each star is eye-like there, 
And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hairAnd 
they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy 
To his love-haunted heart and melancholy. 
The night had found (to him a night of woe) 
Upon a mountain crag, young AngeloBeetling 
it bends athwart the solemn sky, 
And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie. 
Here sat he with his love- his dark eye bent 
With eagle gaze along the firmament: 
Now turn'd it upon her- but ever then 
It trembled to the orb of EARTH again. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


 'Ianthe, dearest, see- how dim that ray! 
How lovely 'tis to look so far away! 
She seem'd not thus upon that autumn eve 
I left her gorgeous halls- nor mourn'd to leave. 
That eve- that eve- I should remember wellThe 
sun-ray dropp'd in Lemnos, with a spell 
On th' arabesque carving of a gilded hall 
Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wallAnd 
on my eyelids- O the heavy light! 
How drowsily it weigh'd them into night! 
On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran 
With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan: 
But O that light!- I slumber'd- Death, the while, 
Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle 
So softly that no single silken hair 
Awoke that slept- or knew that he was there.

 'The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon 
Was a proud temple call'd the Parthenon; 
More beauty clung around her column'd wall 
Than ev'n thy glowing bosom beats withal, 
And when old Time my wing did disenthral 
Thence sprang I- as the eagle from his tower, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And years I left behind me in an hour. 
What time upon her airy bounds I hung, 
One half the garden of her globe was flung 
Unrolling as a chart unto my viewTenantless 
cities of the desert too! 
Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then, 
And half I wish'd to be again of men.'

 'My Angelo! and why of them to be? 
A brighter dwelling-place is here for theeAnd 
greener fields than in yon world above, 
And woman's loveliness- and passionate love.'

 'But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft 
Fail'd, as my pennon'd spirit leapt aloft, 
Perhaps my brain grew dizzy- but the world 
I left so late was into chaos hurl'dSprang 
from her station, on the winds apart. 
And roll'd, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart. 



 Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar 
And fell- not swiftly as I rose before, 
But with a downward, tremulous motion thro' 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto! 
Nor long the measure of my falling hours, 
For nearest of all stars was thine to oursDread 
star! that came, amid a night of mirth, 
A red Daedalion on the timid Earth.'

 'We came- and to thy Earth- but not to us 
Be given our lady's bidding to discuss: 
We came, my love; around, above, below, 
Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go, 
Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod 
She grants to us, as granted by her GodBut, 
Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl'd 
Never his fairy wing O'er fairier world! 
Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes 
Alone could see the phantom in the skies, 
When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be 
Headlong thitherward o'er the starry seaBut 
when its glory swell'd upon the sky, 
As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye, 
We paused before the heritage of men, 
And thy star trembled- as doth Beauty then!'

 Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away 
The night that waned and waned and brought no day. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts 
Who hear not for the beating of their hearts. 




Alone 

From childhood's hour I have not been 
As others were; I have not seen 
As others saw; I could not bring 
My passions from a common spring. 
From the same source I have not taken 
My sorrow; I could not awaken 
My heart to joy at the same tone; 
And all I loved, I loved alone. 
Then- in my childhood, in the dawn 
Of a most stormy life- was drawn 
From every depth of good and ill 
The mystery which binds me still: 
From the torrent, or the fountain, 
From the red cliff of the mountain, 
From the sun that round me rolled 
In its autumn tint of gold, 
From the lightning in the sky 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
As it passed me flying by, 
From the thunder and the storm, 
And the cloud that took the form 
(When the rest of Heaven was blue) 
Of a demon in my view. 




An Acrostic 

Elizabeth it is in vain you say 
'Love not' — thou sayest it in so sweet a way: 
In vain those words from thee or L. E. L. 
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well: 
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise, 
Breathe it less gently forth — and veil thine eyes. 
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried 
To cure his love — was cured of all beside — 
His folly — pride — and passion — for he died. 




An Enigma 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

"Seldom we find," says Solomon Don Dunce, 
"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.

 Through all the flimsy things we see at once 
As easily as through a Naples bonnetTrash 
of all trash!- how can a lady don it?

 Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuffOwl-
downy nonsense that the faintest puff

 Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it." 
And, veritably, Sol is right enough. 
The general tuckermanities are arrant 
Bubbles- ephemeral and so transparent


But this is, now- you may depend upon itStable, 
opaque, immortal- all by dint 
Of the dear names that he concealed within 't. 




Annabel Lee 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

It was many and many a year ago, 
In a kingdom by the sea, 
That a maiden there lived whom you may know 
By the name of ANNABEL LEE; 
And this maiden she lived with no other thought 
Than to love and be loved by me.

 I was a child and she was a child, 
In this kingdom by the sea; 
But we loved with a love that was more than loveI 
and my Annabel Lee; 
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven 
Coveted her and me.

 And this was the reason that, long ago, 
In this kingdom by the sea, 
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling 
My beautiful Annabel Lee; 
So that her highborn kinsman came 
And bore her away from me, 
To shut her up in a sepulchre 
In this kingdom by the sea.

 The angels, not half so happy in heaven, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Went envying her and meYes! 
- that was the reason (as all men know, 
In this kingdom by the sea) 
That the wind came out of the cloud by night, 
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

 But our love it was stronger by far than the love 
Of those who were older than weOf 
many far wiser than we


And neither the angels in heaven above, 
Nor the demons down under the sea, 
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul 
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

 For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams 



 Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 

And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes

 Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side 
Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,

 In the sepulchre there by the sea, 
In her tomb by the sounding sea. 




Bridal Ballad 

The ring is on my hand, 
And the wreath is on my brow; 
Satin and jewels grand 
Are all at my command, 
And I am happy now.

 And my lord he loves me well;

 But, when first he breathed his vow, 
I felt my bosom swellFor 
the words rang as a knell, 
And the voice seemed his who fell 
In the battle down the dell,

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 And who is happy now.

 But he spoke to re-assure me,

 And he kissed my pallid brow, 
While a reverie came o'er me, 
And to the church-yard bore me, 
And I sighed to him before me, 
Thinking him dead D'Elormie, 
"Oh, I am happy now!"

 And thus the words were spoken,

 And this the plighted vow, 
And, though my faith be broken, 
And, though my heart be broken, 
Here is a ring, as token

 That I am happy now!

 Would God I could awaken!

 For I dream I know not how! 
And my soul is sorely shaken 
Lest an evil step be taken,Lest 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
the dead who is forsaken

 May not be happy now. 




Dreamland 

By a route obscure and lonely, 
Haunted by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, 
On a black throne reigns upright, 
I have reached these lands but newly 
From an ultimate dim ThuleFrom 
a wild clime that lieth, sublime,

 Out of SPACE- out of TIME.

 Bottomless vales and boundless floods, 
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods, 
With forms that no man can discover 
For the tears that drip all over; 
Mountains toppling evermore 
Into seas without a shore; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Seas that restlessly aspire, 
Surging, unto skies of fire; 
Lakes that endlessly outspread 
Their lone waters- lone and dead,Their 
still waters- still and chilly 
With the snows of the lolling lily.

 By the lakes that thus outspread 
Their lone waters, lone and dead,Their 
sad waters, sad and chilly 
With the snows of the lolling lily,By 
the mountains- near the river 
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,By 
the grey woods,- by the swamp 
Where the toad and the newt encampBy 
the dismal tarns and pools

 Where dwell the Ghouls,By 
each spot the most unholyIn 
each nook most melancholyThere 
the traveller meets aghast 
Sheeted Memories of the PastShrouded 
forms that start and sigh 
As they pass the wanderer byWhite-
robed forms of friends long given, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>



 In agony, to the Earth- and Heaven.

 For the heart whose woes are legion 
'Tis a peaceful, soothing regionFor 
the spirit that walks in shadow 
'Tis- oh, 'tis an Eldorado! 
But the traveller, travelling through it, 
May not- dare not openly view it! 
Never its mysteries are exposed 
To the weak human eye unclosed; 
So wills its King, who hath forbid 
The uplifting of the fringed lid; 
And thus the sad Soul that here passes 
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

 By a route obscure and lonely, 
Haunted by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, 
On a black throne reigns upright, 
I have wandered home but newly 
From this ultimate dim Thule.

Dreams 

Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!

 My spirit not awakening, till the beam

 Of an Eternity should bring the morrow.

 Yes! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,

 'Twere better than the cold reality

 Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,

 And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,

 A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.

 But should it be- that dream eternally

 Continuing- as dreams have been to me

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 In my young boyhood- should it thus be given,

 'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.

 For I have revell'd, when the sun was bright

 I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light

 And loveliness,- have left my very heart

 In climes of my imagining, apart

 From mine own home, with beings that have been

 Of mine own thought- what more could I have seen?

 'Twas once- and only once- and the wild hour

 From my remembrance shall not pass- some power

 Or spell had bound me- 'twas the chilly wind

 Came o'er me in the night, and left behind

 Its image on my spirit- or the moon
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon

 Too coldly- or the stars- howe'er it was

 That dream was as that night-wind- let it pass.

 I have been happy, tho' in a dream. 
I have been happy- and I love the theme: 
Dreams! in their vivid coloring of life, 
As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife 
Of semblance with reality, which brings 
To the delirious eye, more lovely things 
Of Paradise and Love- and all our own! 
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known. 




Eldorado 

Gaily bedight, 
A gallant knight, 
In sunshine and in shadow, 
Had journeyed long, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Singing a song, 
In search of Eldorado.

 But he grew old


This knight so bold


And o'er his heart a shadow 
Fell as he found 
No spot of ground

 That looked like Eldorado.

 And, as his strength

 Failed him at length,

 He met a pilgrim shadow"
Shadow," said he, 
"Where can it be


This land of Eldorado?"
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 "Over the Mountains

 Of the Moon,

 Down the Valley of the Shadow, 
Ride, boldly ride," 
The shade replied


"If you seek for Eldorado!" 




Elizabeth 

Elizabeth, it surely is most fit 
[Logic and common usage so commanding] 
In thy own book that first thy name be writ, 
Zeno and other sages notwithstanding; 
And I have other reasons for so doing 
Besides my innate love of contradiction; 
Each poet - if a poet - in pursuing 
The muses thro' their bowers of Truth or Fiction, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Has studied very little of his part, 
Read nothing, written less - in short's a fool 
Endued with neither soul, nor sense, nor art, 
Being ignorant of one important rule, 
Employed in even the theses of the schoolCalled 
- I forget the heathenish Greek name 
[Called anything, its meaning is the same] 
"Always write first things uppermost in the heart." 




Enigma 

The noblest name in Allegory's page, 
The hand that traced inexorable rage; 
A pleasing moralist whose page refined, 
Displays the deepest knowledge of the mind; 
A tender poet of a foreign tongue, 
(Indited in the language that he sung.) 
A bard of brilliant but unlicensed page 
At once the shame and glory of our age, 
The prince of harmony and stirling sense, 
The ancient dramatist of eminence, 
The bard that paints imagination's powers, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And him whose song revives departed hours, 
Once more an ancient tragic bard recall, 
In boldness of design surpassing all. 
These names when rightly read, a name [make] known 
Which gathers all their glories in its own. 




Epigram For Wall Street 

I'll tell you a plan for gaining wealth, 
Better than banking, trade or leases — 
Take a bank note and fold it up, 
And then you will find your money in creases! 
This wonderful plan, without danger or loss, 
Keeps your cash in your hands, where nothing can trouble it; 
And every time that you fold it across, 
'Tis as plain as the light of the day that you double it! 




Eulalie 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I dwelt alone 
In a world of moan,

 And my soul was a stagnant tide, 
Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing brideTill 
the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.

 Ah, less- less bright 
The stars of the night 
Than the eyes of the radiant girl! 
That the vapor can make

 With the moon-tints of purple and pearl, 
Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curlCan 
compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie's most humble and careless

 curl.

 Now Doubt- now Pain 
Come never again,

 For her soul gives me sigh for sigh, 
And all day long 
Shines, bright and strong,

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 Astarte within the sky, 
While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eyeWhile 
ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye. 




Evening Star 

'Twas noontide of summer, 
And mid-time of night; 
And stars, in their orbits, 
Shone pale, thro' the light 
Of the brighter, cold moon, 
'Mid planets her slaves, 
Herself in the Heavens,

 Her beam on the waves. 
I gazed awhile 
On her cold smile;

 Too cold- too cold for meThere 
pass'd, as a shroud, 
A fleecy cloud,

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 And I turned away to thee, 
Proud Evening Star, 
In thy glory afar,

 And dearer thy beam shall be; 
For joy to my heart 
Is the proud part

 Thou bearest in Heaven at night, 
And more I admire 
Thy distant fire,

 Than that colder, lowly light. 




Fairy-Land 

Dim vales- and shadowy floodsAnd 
cloudy-looking woods, 
Whose forms we can't discover 
For the tears that drip all over! 
Huge moons there wax and waneAgain- 
again- againEvery 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
moment of the nightForever 
changing placesAnd 
they put out the star-light 
With the breath from their pale faces. 
About twelve by the moon-dial, 
One more filmy than the rest 
(A kind which, upon trial, 
They have found to be the best) 
Comes down- still down- and down, 
With its centre on the crown 
Of a mountain's eminence, 
While its wide circumference 
In easy drapery falls 
Over hamlets, over halls, 
Wherever they may beO'er 
the strange woods- o'er the seaOver 
spirits on the wingOver 
every drowsy thingAnd 
buries them up quite 
In a labyrinth of lightAnd 
then, how deep!- O, deep! 
Is the passion of their sleep. 
In the morning they arise, 
And their moony covering 
Is soaring in the skies, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
With the tempests as they toss, 
Like- almost anythingOr 
a yellow Albatross. 
They use that moon no more 
For the same end as beforeVidelicet, 
a tentWhich 
I think extravagant: 
Its atomies, however, 



 Into a shower dissever, 
Of which those butterflies 
Of Earth, who seek the skies, 
And so come down again, 
(Never-contented things!) 
Have brought a specimen 
Upon their quivering wings. 




For Annie 

Thank Heaven! the crisisThe 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
danger is past, 
And the lingering illness 
Is over at lastAnd 
the fever called "Living" 
Is conquered at last.

 Sadly, I know 
I am shorn of my strength, 
And no muscle I move 
As I lie at full lengthBut 
no matter!-I feel 
I am better at length.

 And I rest so composedly, 
Now, in my bed 
That any beholder 
Might fancy me deadMight 
start at beholding me, 
Thinking me dead.

 The moaning and groaning, 
The sighing and sobbing, 
Are quieted now, 
With that horrible throbbing 
At heart:- ah, that horrible, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Horrible throbbing!

 The sickness- the nauseaThe 
pitiless painHave 
ceased, with the fever 
That maddened my brainWith 
the fever called "Living" 
That burned in my brain.

 And oh! of all tortures 
That torture the worst 
Has abated- the terrible 
Torture of thirst 



 For the naphthaline river 
Of Passion accurst:I 
have drunk of a water 
That quenches all thirst:


Of a water that flows, 
With a lullaby sound, 
From a spring but a very few 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Feet under groundFrom 
a cavern not very far 
Down under ground.

 And ah! let it never 
Be foolishly said 
That my room it is gloomy 
And narrow my bed; 
For man never slept 
In a different bedAnd, 
to sleep, you must slumber 
In just such a bed.

 My tantalized spirit 
Here blandly reposes, 
Forgetting, or never 
Regretting its rosesIts 
old agitations 
Of myrtles and roses:

 For now, while so quietly 
Lying, it fancies 
A holier odor 
About it, of pansiesA 
rosemary odor, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Commingled with pansiesWith 
rue and the beautiful 
Puritan pansies.

 And so it lies happily, 
Bathing in many 
A dream of the truth 
And the beauty of AnnieDrowned 
in a bath 



 Of the tresses of Annie.

 She tenderly kissed me, 
She fondly caressed, 
And then I fell gently 
To sleep on her breastDeeply 
to sleep 
From the heaven of her breast.

 When the light was extinguished, 
She covered me warm, 
And she prayed to the angels

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 To keep me from harmTo 
the queen of the angels 
To shield me from harm.

 And I lie so composedly, 
Now, in my bed, 
(Knowing her love) 
That you fancy me deadAnd 
I rest so contentedly, 
Now, in my bed, 
(With her love at my breast) 
That you fancy me deadThat 
you shudder to look at me, 
Thinking me dead.

 But my heart it is brighter 
Than all of the many 
Stars in the sky, 
For it sparkles with AnnieIt 
glows with the light

 Of the love of my AnnieWith 
the thought of the light 
Of the eyes of my Annie.

Hymn 

At morn- at noon- at twilight dimMaria! 
thou hast heard my hymn! 
In joy and woe- in good and illMother 
of God, be with me still! 
When the hours flew brightly by, 
And not a cloud obscured the sky, 
My soul, lest it should truant be, 
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee; 
Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast 
Darkly my Present and my Past, 
Let my Future radiant shine 
With sweet hopes of thee and thine! 




Hymn To Aristogeiton And Harmodius 

Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal 
Like those champions devoted and brave, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
When they plunged in the tyrant their steel, 
And to Athens deliverance gave. 

Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam 
In the joy breathing isles of the blest; 
Where the mighty of old have their home Where 
Achilles and Diomed rest. 

In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine, 
Like Harmodious, the gallant and good, 
When he made at the tutelar shrine 
A libation of Tyranny's blood. 

Ye deliverers of Athens from shame! 
Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs! 
Endless ages shall cherish your fame 
Embalmed in their echoing songs! 




Imitation 

A dark unfathomed tide 
Of interminable pride A 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
mystery, and a dream, 
Should my early life seem; 
I say that dream was fraught 
With a wild and waking thought 
Of beings that have been, 
Which my spirit hath not seen, 
Had I let them pass me by, 
With a dreaming eye! 
Let none of earth inherit 
That vision of my spirit; 
Those thoughts I would control, 
As a spell upon his soul: 
For that bright hope at last 
And that light time have past, 
And my worldly rest hath gone 
With a sigh as it passed on: 
I care not though it perish 
With a thought I then did cherish 




Impromptu - To Kate Carol 

When from your gems of thought I turn 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To those pure orbs, your heart to learn, 
I scarce know which to prize most high — 
The bright i-dea, or the bright dear-eye. 




In The Greenest Of Our Valleys 

I. 
In the greenest of our valleys, 
By good angels tenanted, 
Once fair and stately palace -Radiant 
palace --reared its head. 
In the monarch Thought's dominion -It 
stood there! 
Never seraph spread a pinion 
Over fabric half so fair.

 II.

 Banners yellow, glorious, golden, 
On its roof did float and flow; 
(This --all this --was in the olden

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 Time long ago) 
And every gentle air that dallied, 
In that sweet day, 
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, 
A winged odour went away.

 III. 
Wanderers in that happy valley 
Through two luminous windows saw 
Spirits moving musically 
To a lute's well-tuned law, 
Round about a throne, where sitting 
(Porphyrogene!) 
In state his glory well befitting, 
The ruler of the realm was seen.

 IV. 
And all with pearl and ruby glowing 
Was the fair palace door, 
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing 
And sparkling evermore, 
A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty 
Was but to sing, 
In voices of surpassing beauty, 
The wit and wisdom of their king. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>



 V. 
But evil things, in robes of sorrow, 
Assailed the monarch's high estate; 
(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow 
Shall dawn upon him, desolate!) 
And, round about his home, the glory 
That blushed and bloomed 
Is but a dim-remembered story 
Of the old time entombed.

 VI. 
And travellers now within that valley, 
Through the red-litten windows, see 
Vast forms that move fantastically 
To a discordant melody; 
While, like a rapid ghastly river, 
Through the pale door, 
A hideous throng rush out forever, 
And laugh --but smile no more.

In Youth I Have Known One 

How often we forget all time, when lone 
Admiring Nature's universal throne; 
Her woods - her winds - her mountains - the intense 
Reply of Hers to Our intelligence! 

I. 

In youth I have known one with whom the Earth 
In secret communing held - as he with it, 
In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth: 
Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit 
From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth 
A passionate light - such for his spirit was fit And 
yet that spirit knew - not in the hour 
Of its own fervour - what had o'er it power.

 II. 

Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought 
To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o'er, 
But I will half believe that wild light fraught 
With more of sovereignty than ancient lore 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Hath ever told - or is it of a thought 
The unembodied essence, and no more 
That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass 
As dew of the night time, o'er the summer grass?

 III. 

Doth o'er us pass, when as th' expanding eye 
To the loved object - so the tear to the lid 
Will start, which lately slept in apathy? 
And yet it need not be - (that object) hid 
From us in life - but common - which doth lie 
Each hour before us - but then only bid 
With a strange sound, as of a harpstring broken 
T' awake us - 'Tis a symbol and a token 


IV. 



Of what in other worlds shall be - and given 
In beauty by our God, to those alone 
Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven 
Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven 
Though not with Faith - with godliness - whose throne 
With desperate energy 't hath beaten down; 
Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown. 




Israfel 

In Heaven a spirit doth dwell

 "Whose heart-strings are a lute"; 
None sing so wildly well 
As the angel Israfel, 
And the giddy stars (so legends tell), 
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell

 Of his voice, all mute.

 Tottering above 
In her highest noon, 
The enamored moon

 Blushes with love, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
While, to listen, the red levin 
(With the rapid Pleiads, even, 
Which were seven,) 
Pauses in Heaven.

 And they say (the starry choir

 And the other listening things) 
That Israfeli's fire 
Is owing to that lyre

 By which he sits and singsThe 
trembling living wire 
Of those unusual strings.

 But the skies that angel trod, 
Where deep thoughts are a dutyWhere 
Love's a grown-up GodWhere 
the Houri glances are 
Imbued with all the beauty 
Which we worship in a star.

 Therefore thou art not wrong,

 Israfeli, who despisest 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
An unimpassioned song; 
To thee the laurels belong,

 Best bard, because the wisest! 
Merrily live, and long! 



 The ecstasies above 
With thy burning measures suit


Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love, 
With the fervor of thy luteWell 
may the stars be mute!

 Yes, Heaven is thine; but this 
Is a world of sweets and sours; 
Our flowers are merely- flowers,

 And the shadow of thy perfect bliss 
Is the sunshine of ours.

 If I could dwell 
Where Israfel 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Hath dwelt, and he where I, 
He might not sing so wildly well

 A mortal melody, 
While a bolder note than this might swell 
From my lyre within the sky. 




Lenore 

Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever! 
Let the bell toll!- a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river; 
And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?- weep now or nevermore! 
See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore! 
Come! let the burial rite be read- the funeral song be sung!An 
anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so youngA 
dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.

 "Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride, 
And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her- that she died! 
How shall the ritual, then, be read?- the requiem how be sung 
By you- by yours, the evil eye,- by yours, the slanderous tongue 
That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?"
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 Peccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song 
Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong. 
The sweet Lenore hath "gone before," with Hope, that flew beside, 
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy

 bride. 
For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies, 
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes 
The life still there, upon her hair- the death upon her eyes.

 "Avaunt! avaunt! from fiends below, the indignant ghost is rivenFrom 
Hell unto a high estate far up within the HeavenFrom 
grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of

 Heaven! 
Let no bell toll, then,- lest her soul, amid its hallowed mirth, 
Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damned Earth! 
And I!- to-night my heart is light!- no dirge will I upraise, 
But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days!" 




Romance 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Romance, who loves to nod and sing, 
With drowsy head and folded wing, 
Among the green leaves as they shake 
Far down within some shadowy lake, 
To me a painted paroquet 
Hath been- a most familiar birdTaught 
me my alphabet to sayTo 
lisp my very earliest word 
While in the wild wood I did lie, 
A child- with a most knowing eye.

 Of late, eternal Condor years 
So shake the very Heaven on high 
With tumult as they thunder by, 
I have no time for idle cares 
Through gazing on the unquiet sky. 
And when an hour with calmer wings 
Its down upon my spirit flingsThat 
little time with lyre and rhyme 
To while away- forbidden things! 
My heart would feel to be a crime 
Unless it trembled with the strings. 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


Sancta Maria 

Sancta Maria! turn thine eyes Upon 
the sinner's sacrifice, 
Of fervent prayer and humble love, 
From thy holy throne above. 
At morn - at noon - at twilight dim Maria! 
thou hast heard my hymn! 
In joy and wo - in good and ill Mother 
of God, be with me still! 

When the Hours flew brightly by, 
And not a cloud obscured the sky, 
My soul, lest it should truant be, 
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee; 

Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast 
Darkly my Present and my Past, 
Let my Future radiant shine 
With sweet hopes of thee and thine! 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Serenade 

So sweet the hour, so calm the time, 
I feel it more than half a crime, 
When Nature sleeps and stars are mute, 
To mar the silence ev'n with lute. 
At rest on ocean's brilliant dyes 
An image of Elysium lies: 
Seven Pleiades entranced in Heaven, 
Form in the deep another seven: 
Endymion nodding from above 
Sees in the sea a second love. 
Within the valleys dim and brown, 
And on the spectral mountain's crown, 
The wearied light is dying down, 
And earth, and stars, and sea, and sky 
Are redolent of sleep, as I 
Am redolent of thee and thine 
Enthralling love, my Adeline. 
But list, O list,- so soft and low 
Thy lover's voice tonight shall flow, 
That, scarce awake, thy soul shall deem 
My words the music of a dream. 
Thus, while no single sound too rude 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Upon thy slumber shall intrude, 
Our thoughts, our souls- O God above! 
In every deed shall mingle, love. 




Song 

I saw thee on thy bridal dayWhen 
a burning blush came o'er thee, 
Though happiness around thee lay, 
The world all love before thee:

 And in thine eye a kindling light 
(Whatever it might be) 
Was all on Earth my aching sight 
Of Loveliness could see.

 That blush, perhaps, was maiden shameAs 
such it well may passThough 
its glow hath raised a fiercer flame 
In the breast of him, alas!

 Who saw thee on that bridal day, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
When that deep blush would come o'er thee, 
Though happiness around thee lay; 
The world all love before thee. 




Sonnet- Silence 

There are some qualities- some incorporate things, 
That have a double life, which thus is made 
A type of that twin entity which springs 
From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.

 There is a two-fold Silence- sea and shoreBody 
and soul. One dwells in lonely places, 
Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,

 Some human memories and tearful lore, 
Render him terrorless: his name's "No More." 
He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!

 No power hath he of evil in himself; 
But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf, 
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod 
No foot of man,) commend thyself to God! 




Sonnet- To Science 

Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art! 
Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes. 
Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart, 
Vulture, whose wings are dull realities? 
How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise, 
Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering 
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,

 Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing? 
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car? 
And driven the Hamadryad from the wood

 To seek a shelter in some happier star?

 Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood, 
The Elfin from the green grass, and from me 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree? 




Sonnet- To Zante 

Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers, 
Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take! 
How many memories of what radiant hours 
At sight of thee and thine at once awake! 
How many scenes of what departed bliss! 
How many thoughts of what entombed hopes! 
How many visions of a maiden that is 
No more- no more upon thy verdant slopes! 
No more! alas, that magical sad sound 
Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no moreThy 
memory no more! Accursed ground 
Henceforth I hold thy flower-enameled shore, 
O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante! 
"Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!"

Spirits Of The Dead 

Thy soul shall find itself alone 
'Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone; 
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry 
Into thine hour of secrecy.

 Be silent in that solitude, 
Which is not loneliness- for then 
The spirits of the dead, who stood

 In life before thee, are again 
In death around thee, and their will 
Shall overshadow thee; be still.

 The night, though clear, shall frown, 
And the stars shall not look down 
From their high thrones in the Heaven 
With light like hope to mortals given, 
But their red orbs, without beam, 
To thy weariness shall seem 
As a burning and a fever 
Which would cling to thee for ever.

 Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Now are visions ne'er to vanish; 
From thy spirit shall they pass 
No more, like dew-drop from the grass.

 The breeze, the breath of God, is still, 
And the mist upon the hill 
Shadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken, 
Is a symbol and a token. 
How it hangs upon the trees, 
A mystery of mysteries! 




Stanzas 

How often we forget all time, when lone 
Admiring Nature's universal throne; 
Her woods- her wilds- her mountains- the intense 
Reply of HERS to OUR intelligence! [BYRON, The Island.]

 I

 In youth have I known one with whom the Earth 
In secret communing held- as he with it, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In daylight, and in beauty from his birth: 
Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit 
From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth 
A passionate light- such for his spirit was fitAnd 
yet that spirit knew not, in the hour 
Of its own fervor what had o'er it power.

 II

 Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought 
To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o'er, 
But I will half believe that wild light fraught 
With more of sovereignty than ancient lore 
Hath ever told- or is it of a thought 
The unembodied essence, and no more, 
That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass 
As dew of the night-time o'er the summer grass?

 III

 Doth o'er us pass, when, as th' expanding eye 
To the loved object- so the tear to the lid 
Will start, which lately slept in apathy? 
And yet it need not be- (that object) hid 
From us in life- but common- which doth lie 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Each hour before us- but then only, bid 
With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken, 
To awake us- 'Tis a symbol and a token 



 IV

 Of what in other worlds shall be- and given 
In beauty by our God, to those alone 
Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven 
Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone, 
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven, 
Tho' not with Faith- with godliness- whose throne 
With desperate energy 't hath beaten down; 
Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown. 




Tamerlane 

Kind solace in a dying hour! 
Such, father, is not (now) my theme

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

I will not madly deem that power 
Of Earth may shrive me of the sin 
Unearthly pride hath revell'd in


I have no time to dote or dream: 
You call it hope- that fire of fire! 
It is but agony of desire: 
If I can hope- Oh God! I can


Its fount is holier- more divineI 
would not call thee fool, old man, 
But such is not a gift of thine.

 Know thou the secret of a spirit 
Bow'd from its wild pride into shame. 
O yearning heart! I did inherit

 Thy withering portion with the fame, 
The searing glory which hath shone 
Amid the jewels of my throne, 
Halo of Hell! and with a pain 
Not Hell shall make me fear againO 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
craving heart, for the lost flowers 
And sunshine of my summer hours! 
The undying voice of that dead time, 
With its interminable chime, 
Rings, in the spirit of a spell, 
Upon thy emptiness- a knell.

 I have not always been as now: 
The fever'd diadem on my brow 
I claim'd and won usurpingly


Hath not the same fierce heirdom given 
Rome to the Caesar- this to me? 
The heritage of a kingly mind, 
And a proud spirit which hath striven 
Triumphantly with human kind.

 On mountain soil I first drew life: 
The mists of the Taglay have shed 



 Nightly their dews upon my head, 
And, I believe, the winged strife 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And tumult of the headlong air 
Have nestled in my very hair.

 So late from Heaven- that dew- it fell 
(Mid dreams of an unholy night) 
Upon me with the touch of Hell, 
While the red flashing of the light

 From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er, 
Appeared to my half-closing eye 
The pageantry of monarchy,

 And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar 
Came hurriedly upon me, telling 
Of human battle, where my voice, 
My own voice, silly child!- was swelling

 (O! how my spirit would rejoice, 
And leap within me at the cry) 
The battle-cry of Victory!

 The rain came down upon my head 
Unshelter'd- and the heavy wind 
Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 It was but man, I thought, who shed 
Laurels upon me: and the rushThe 
torrent of the chilly air

 Gurgled within my ear the crush 
Of empires- with the captive's prayerThe 
hum of suitors- and the tone 
Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.

 My passions, from that hapless hour, 
Usurp'd a tyranny which men 
Have deem'd, since I have reach'd to power, 
My innate nature- be it so: 
But father, there liv'd one who, then, 
Then- in my boyhood- when their fire 
Burn'd with a still intenser glow,

 (For passion must, with youth, expire) 
E'en then who knew this iron heart 
In woman's weakness had a part. 



 I have no words- alas!- to tell 
The loveliness of loving well! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Nor would I now attempt to trace 
The more than beauty of a face 
Whose lineaments, upon my mind, 
Are- shadows on th' unstable wind: 
Thus I remember having dwelt

 Some page of early lore upon, 
With loitering eye, till I have felt 
The letters- with their meaning- melt

 To fantasies- with none.

 O, she was worthy of all love! 
Love- as in infancy was mine'
Twas such as angel minds above 
Might envy; her young heart the shrine 
On which my every hope and thought 
Were incense- then a goodly gift, 
For they were childish and uprightPure- 
as her young example taught: 
Why did I leave it, and, adrift, 
Trust to the fire within, for light?

 We grew in age- and love- together, 
Roaming the forest, and the wild; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
My breast her shield in wintry weather


And when the friendly sunshine smil'd, 
And she would mark the opening skies, 
I saw no Heaven- but in her eyes.

 Young Love's first lesson is- the heart: 
For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles, 
When, from our little cares apart, 
And laughing at her girlish wiles, 
I'd throw me on her throbbing breast, 
And pour my spirit out in tearsThere 
was no need to speak the rest


No need to quiet any fears 
Of her- who ask'd no reason why, 
But turn'd on me her quiet eye!

 Yet more than worthy of the love 



 My spirit struggled with, and strove, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
When, on the mountain peak, alone, 
Ambition lent it a new toneI 
had no being- but in thee:

 The world, and all it did contain 
In the earth- the air- the seaIts 
joy- its little lot of pain 
That was new pleasure- the ideal, 
Dim vanities of dreams by night


And dimmer nothings which were real(
Shadows- and a more shadowy light!)

 Parted upon their misty wings, 
And, so, confusedly, became 
Thine image, and- a name- a name!

 Two separate- yet most intimate things.

 I was ambitious- have you known

 The passion, father? You have not: 
A cottager, I mark'd a throne 
Of half the world as all my own,
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 And murmur'd at such lowly lotBut, 
just like any other dream, 
Upon the vapour of the dew 
My own had past, did not the beam

 Of beauty which did while it thro' 
The minute- the hour- the day- oppress 
My mind with double loveliness.

 We walk'd together on the crown 
Of a high mountain which look'd down 
Afar from its proud natural towers

 Of rock and forest, on the hillsThe 
dwindled hills! begirt with bowers, 
And shouting with a thousand rills.

 I spoke to her of power and pride, 
But mystically- in such guise 
That she might deem it nought beside 
The moment's converse; in her eyes 
I read, perhaps too carelesslyA 
mingled feeling with my own-

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


 The flush on her bright cheek, to me

 Seem'd to become a queenly throne 
Too well that I should let it be

 Light in the wilderness alone.

 I wrapp'd myself in grandeur then,

 And donn'd a visionary crown


Yet it was not that Fantasy

 Had thrown her mantle over meBut 
that, among the rabble- men,

 Lion ambition is chained downAnd 
crouches to a keeper's handNot 
so in deserts where the grandThe 
wild- the terrible conspire 
With their own breath to fan his fire.

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 Look 'round thee now on Samarcand!

 Is not she queen of Earth? her pride 
Above all cities? in her hand

 Their destinies? in all beside 
Of glory which the world hath known 
Stands she not nobly and alone? 
Falling- her veriest stepping-stone 
Shall form the pedestal of a throneAnd 
who her sovereign? Timour- he

 Whom the astonished people saw 
Striding o'er empires haughtily

 A diadem'd outlaw!

 O, human love! thou spirit given 
On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven! 
Which fall'st into the soul like rain 
Upon the Siroc-wither'd plain, 
And, failing in thy power to bless, 
But leav'st the heart a wilderness! 
Idea! which bindest life around 
With music of so strange a sound, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And beauty of so wild a birthFarewell! 
for I have won the Earth.

 When Hope, the eagle that tower'd, could see 
No cliff beyond him in the sky, 



 His pinions were bent droopingly


And homeward turn'd his soften'd eye. 
'Twas sunset: when the sun will part 
There comes a sullenness of heart 
To him who still would look upon 
The glory of the summer sun. 
That soul will hate the ev'ning mist, 
So often lovely, and will list 
To the sound of the coming darkness (known 
To those whose spirits hearken) as one 
Who, in a dream of night, would fly 
But cannot from a danger nigh.

 What tho' the moon- the white moon 
Shed all the splendour of her noon, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Her smile is chilly, and her beam, 
In that time of dreariness, will seem 
(So like you gather in your breath) 
A portrait taken after death. 
And boyhood is a summer sun 
Whose waning is the dreariest oneFor 
all we live to know is known, 
And all we seek to keep hath flownLet 
life, then, as the day-flower, fall 
With the noon-day beauty- which is all.

 I reach'd my home- my home no more 
For all had flown who made it so. 
I pass'd from out its mossy door,

 And, tho' my tread was soft and low, 
A voice came from the threshold stone 
Of one whom I had earlier known


O, I defy thee, Hell, to show 
On beds of fire that burn below, 
A humbler heart- a deeper woe.

 Father, I firmly do believeI 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
know- for Death, who comes for me 
From regions of the blest afar, 
Where there is nothing to deceive, 
Hath left his iron gate ajar, 
And rays of truth you cannot see 



 Are flashing thro' EternityI 
do believe that Eblis hath 
A snare in every human pathElse 
how, when in the holy grove 
I wandered of the idol, Love, 
Who daily scents his snowy wings 
With incense of burnt offerings 
From the most unpolluted things, 
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven 
Above with trellis'd rays from Heaven, 
No mote may shun- no tiniest flyThe 
lightning of his eagle eyeHow 
was it that Ambition crept,

 Unseen, amid the revels there, 
Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt 
In the tangles of Love's very hair?

The Bells 

I

 Hear the sledges with the bellsSilver 
bells! 
What a world of merriment their melody foretells! 
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,

 In the icy air of night! 
While the stars that oversprinkle 
All the heavens, seem to twinkle

 With a crystalline delight; 
Keeping time, time, time, 
In a sort of Runic rhyme, 
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells 
From the bells, bells, bells, bells, 
Bells, bells, bellsFrom 
the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 II

 Hear the mellow wedding bells, 
Golden bells!

 What a world of happiness their harmony foretells! 
Through the balmy air of night 
How they ring out their delight!

 From the molten-golden notes, 
And an in tune, 
What a liquid ditty floats 
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats 
On the moon! 
Oh, from out the sounding cells,

 What a gush of euphony voluminously wells! 
How it swells! 
How it dwells

 On the Future! how it tells 
Of the rapture that impels 
To the swinging and the ringing 
Of the bells, bells, bells, 
Of the bells, bells, bells,bells, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Bells, bells, bells-



 To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells! 

III

 Hear the loud alarum bellsBrazen 
bells! 
What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells! 
In the startled ear of night

 How they scream out their affright! 
Too much horrified to speak, 
They can only shriek, shriek,

 Out of tune, 
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, 
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,

 Leaping higher, higher, higher,

 With a desperate desire, 
And a resolute endeavor, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Now- now to sit or never,

 By the side of the pale-faced moon. 
Oh, the bells, bells, bells! 
What a tale their terror tells

 Of Despair! 
How they clang, and clash, and roar! 
What a horror they outpour

 On the bosom of the palpitating air!

 Yet the ear it fully knows, 
By the twanging, 
And the clanging,

 How the danger ebbs and flows:

 Yet the ear distinctly tells, 
In the jangling, 
And the wrangling,

 How the danger sinks and swells, 
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bellsOf 
the bellsOf 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
the bells, bells, bells,bells, 
Bells, bells, bellsIn 
the clamor and the clangor of the bells!

 IV

 Hear the tolling of the bells-



 Iron Bells!

 What a world of solemn thought their monody compels! 
In the silence of the night, 
How we shiver with affright

 At the melancholy menace of their tone! 
For every sound that floats 
From the rust within their throats

 Is a groan. 
And the people- ah, the peopleThey 
that dwell up in the steeple,

 All Alone 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And who, tolling, tolling, tolling, 
In that muffled monotone, 
Feel a glory in so rolling

 On the human heart a stoneThey 
are neither man nor womanThey 
are neither brute nor human


They are Ghouls: 
And their king it is who tolls; 
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,

 Rolls 
A paean from the bells! 
And his merry bosom swells

 With the paean of the bells! 
And he dances, and he yells; 
Keeping time, time, time, 
In a sort of Runic rhyme,

 To the paean of the bells


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of the bells: 
Keeping time, time, time, 
In a sort of Runic rhyme,

 To the throbbing of the bellsOf 
the bells, bells, bellsTo 
the sobbing of the bells; 
Keeping time, time, time, 
As he knells, knells, knells, 
In a happy Runic rhyme, 
To the rolling of the bellsOf 
the bells, bells, bells: 
To the tolling of the bells, 
Of the bells, bells, bells, bellsBells, 
bells, bells-



 To the moaning and the groaning of the bells. 



The Bells - A Collaboration 

The bells! — ah, the bells! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The little silver bells! 
How fairy-like a melody there floats 
From their throats. — 
From their merry little throats — 
From the silver, tinkling throats 
Of the bells, bells, bells — 
Of the bells! 

The bells! — ah, the bells! 
The heavy iron bells! 
How horrible a monody there floats 
From their throats — 
From their deep-toned throats — 
From their melancholy throats! 
How I shudder at the notes 
Of the bells, bells, bells — 
Of the bells! 




The City In The Sea 

Lo! Death has reared himself a throne 
In a strange city lying alone 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Far down within the dim West, 
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best 
Have gone to their eternal rest. 
There shrines and palaces and towers 
(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!) 
Resemble nothing that is ours. 
Around, by lifting winds forgot, 
Resignedly beneath the sky 
The melancholy waters he.

 No rays from the holy heaven come down 
On the long night-time of that town; 
But light from out the lurid sea 
Streams up the turrets silentlyGleams 
up the pinnacles far and freeUp 
domes- up spires- up kingly hallsUp 
fanes- up Babylon-like wallsUp 
shadowy long-forgotten bowers 
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowersUp 
many and many a marvellous shrine 
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine 
The viol, the violet, and the vine. 
Resignedly beneath the sky 
The melancholy waters lie. 
So blend the turrets and shadows there 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That all seem pendulous in air, 
While from a proud tower in the town 
Death looks gigantically down.

 There open fanes and gaping graves 
Yawn level with the luminous waves; 
But not the riches there that lie 
In each idol's diamond eyeNot 
the gaily-jewelled dead 
Tempt the waters from their bed; 
For no ripples curl, alas! 
Along that wilderness of glass-



 No swellings tell that winds may be 
Upon some far-off happier seaNo 
heavings hint that winds have been 
On seas less hideously serene.

 But lo, a stir is in the air! 
The wave- there is a movement there! 
As if the towers had thrust aside, 
In slightly sinking, the dull tideAs 
if their tops had feebly given 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
A void within the filmy Heaven. 
The waves have now a redder glowThe 
hours are breathing faint and lowAnd 
when, amid no earthly moans, 
Down, down that town shall settle hence, 
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones, 
Shall do it reverence. 




The City Of Sin 

LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne 
In a strange city, all alone, 
Far down within the dim west — 
Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best, 
Have gone to their eternal rest. 
? 
There shrines, and palaces, and towers 
Are — not like any thing of ours — 
Oh no! — O no! — ours never loom 
To heaven with that ungodly gloom! 
Time-eaten towers that tremble not! 
Resemble nothing that is ours. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Around, by lifting winds forgot, 
Resignedly beneath the sky 
The melancholy waters lie. 
? 
No holy rays from heaven come down 
On the long night-time of that town, 
But light from out the lurid sea 
Streams up the turrets silently — 
Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers 
Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers — 
Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls — 
Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls — 
Up many a melancholy shrine 
Whose entablatures intertwine 
The mask — the viol — and the vine. 
? 
There open temples — open graves 
Are on a level with the waves — 
But not the riches there that lie 
In each idol's diamond eye, 
Not the gaily-jewell'd dead 
Tempt the waters from their bed: 
For no ripples curl, alas! 
Along that wilderness of glass — 
No swellings hint that winds may be 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Upon a far-off happier sea: 
So blend the turrets and shadows there 



That all seem pendulous in air, 
While from the high towers of the town 
Death looks gigantically down. 
? 
But lo! a stir is in the air! 
The wave — there is a ripple there! 
As if the towers had thrown aside, 
In slightly sinking, the dull tide — 
As if the turret-tops had given 
A vacuum in the filmy heaven. 
The waves have now a redder glow — 
The very hours are breathing low — 
And when, amid no earthly moans, 
Down, down, that town shall settle hence, 
All Hades, from a thousand thrones, 
Shall do it reverence, 
And Death to some more happy clime 
Shall give his undivided time.

The Coliseum 

Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary 
Of lofty contemplation left to Time 
By buried centuries of pomp and power! 
At length- at length- after so many days 
Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst, 
(Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,) 
I kneel, an altered and an humble man, 
Amid thy shadows, and so drink within 
My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!

 Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld! 
Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night! 
I feel ye now- I feel ye in your strengthO 
spells more sure than e'er Judaean king 
Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane! 
O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee 
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!

 Here, where a hero fell, a column falls! 
Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold, 
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair 
Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle! 
Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled, 
Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home, 
Lit by the wan light of the horned moon, 
The swift and silent lizard of the stones!

 But stay! these walls- these ivy-clad arcadesThese 
moldering plinths- these sad and blackened shaftsThese 
vague entablatures- this crumbling friezeThese 
shattered cornices- this wreck- this ruinThese 
stones- alas! these grey stones- are they allAll 
of the famed, and the colossal left 
By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?

 'Not all'- the Echoes answer me- 'not all! 
Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever 
From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise, 



 As melody from Memnon to the Sun. 
We rule the hearts of mightiest men- we rule 
With a despotic sway all giant minds. 
We are not impotent- we pallid stones. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Not all our power is gone- not all our fameNot 
all the magic of our high renownNot 
all the wonder that encircles usNot 
all the mysteries that in us lieNot 
all the memories that hang upon 
And cling around about us as a garment, 
Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.' 




The Conqueror Worm 

Lo! 'tis a gala night 
Within the lonesome latter years! 
An angel throng, bewinged, bedight 
In veils, and drowned in tears, 
Sit in a theatre, to see 
A play of hopes and fears, 
While the orchestra breathes fitfully 
The music of the spheres.

 Mimes, in the form of God on high, 
Mutter and mumble low, 
And hither and thither flyMere 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
puppets they, who come and go 
At bidding of vast formless things 
That shift the scenery to and fro, 
Flapping from out their Condor wings 
Invisible Woe!

 That motley drama- oh, be sure 
It shall not be forgot! 
With its Phantom chased for evermore, 
By a crowd that seize it not, 
Through a circle that ever returneth in 
To the self-same spot, 
And much of Madness, and more of Sin, 
And Horror the soul of the plot.

 But see, amid the mimic rout 
A crawling shape intrude! 
A blood-red thing that writhes from out 
The scenic solitude! 
It writhes!- it writhes!- with mortal pangs 
The mimes become its food, 
And seraphs sob at vermin fangs 
In human gore imbued.

 Out- out are the lights- out all! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And, over each quivering form, 
The curtain, a funeral pall, 



 Comes down with the rush of a storm, 
While the angels, all pallid and wan, 
Uprising, unveiling, affirm 
That the play is the tragedy, 'Man,' 
And its hero the Conqueror Worm. 




The Divine Right Of Kings 

The only king by right divine 
Is Ellen King, and were she mine 
I'd strive for liberty no more, 
But hug the glorious chains I wore. 

Her bosom is an ivory throne, 
Where tyrant virtue reigns alone ; 
No subject vice dare interfere, 
To check the power that governs here. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

O! would she deign to rule my fate, 
I'd worship Kings and kingly state, 
And hold this maxim all life long, 
The King — my King — can do no wrong. 




The Forest Reverie 

'Tis said that when 
The hands of men 
Tamed this primeval wood, 
And hoary trees with groans of woe, 
Like warriors by an unknown foe, 
Were in their strength subdued, 
The virgin Earth Gave instant birth 
To springs that ne'er did flow 
That in the sun Did rivulets run, 
And all around rare flowers did blow 
The wild rose pale Perfumed the gale 
And the queenly lily adown the dale 
(Whom the sun and the dew 
And the winds did woo), 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew. 

So when in tears 
The love of years 
Is wasted like the snow, 
And the fine fibrils of its life 
By the rude wrong of instant strife 
Are broken at a blow 
Within the heart 
Do springs upstart 
Of which it doth now know, 
And strange, sweet dreams, 
Like silent streams 
That from new fountains overflow, 
With the earlier tide 
Of rivers glide 
Deep in the heart whose hope has died-Quenching 
the fires its ashes hide,-Its 
ashes, whence will spring and grow 
Sweet flowers, ere long, 
The rare and radiant flowers of song!

The Happiest Day, The Happiest Hour 

The happiest day- the happiest hour 
My sear'd and blighted heart hath known, 
The highest hope of pride and power, 
I feel hath flown.

 Of power! said I? yes! such I ween; 
But they have vanish'd long, alas! 
The visions of my youth have been


But let them pass.

 And, pride, what have I now with thee? 
Another brow may even inherit 
The venom thou hast pour'd on me 
Be still, my spirit!

 The happiest day- the happiest hour 
Mine eyes shall see- have ever seen, 
The brightest glance of pride and power, 
I feel- have been:

 But were that hope of pride and power 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Now offer'd with the pain 
Even then I felt- that brightest hour 
I would not live again:

 For on its wing was dark alloy, 
And, as it flutter'd- fell 
An essence- powerful to destroy 
A soul that knew it well. 




The Haunted Palace 

In the greenest of our valleys 
By good angels tenanted, 
Once a fair and stately palaceRadiant 
palace- reared its head. 
In the monarch Thought's dominionIt 
stood there! 
Never seraph spread a pinion 
Over fabric half so fair!

 Banners yellow, glorious, golden, 
On its roof did float and flow, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
(This- all this- was in the olden 
Time long ago,) 
And every gentle air that dallied, 
In that sweet day, 
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, 
A winged odor went away.

 Wanderers in that happy valley, 
Through two luminous windows, saw 
Spirits moving musically, 
To a lute's well-tuned law, 
Round about a throne where, sitting 
(Porphyrogene!) 
In state his glory well-befitting, 
The ruler of the realm was seen.

 And all with pearl and ruby glowing 
Was the fair palace door, 
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing, 
And sparkling evermore, 
A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty 
Was but to sing, 
In voices of surpassing beauty, 
The wit and wisdom of their king.

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 But evil things, in robes of sorrow, 
Assailed the monarch's high estate. 
(Ah, let us mourn!- for never morrow 



 Shall dawn upon him desolate!) 
And round about his home the glory 
That blushed and bloomed, 
Is but a dim-remembered story 
Of the old time entombed.

 And travellers, now, within that valley, 
Through the red-litten windows see 
Vast forms, that move fantastically 
To a discordant melody, 
While, like a ghastly rapid river, 
Through the pale door 
A hideous throng rush out forever 
And laugh- but smile no more.

 -THE END.

The Lake 

In spring of youth it was my lot 
To haunt of the wide world a spot 
The which I could not love the lessSo 
lovely was the loneliness 
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound, 
And the tall pines that towered around.

 But when the Night had thrown her pall 
Upon that spot, as upon all, 
And the mystic wind went by 
Murmuring in melodyThen- 
ah then I would awake 
To the terror of the lone lake.

 Yet that terror was not fright, 
But a tremulous delightA 
feeling not the jewelled mine 
Could teach or bribe me to defineNor 
Love- although the Love were thine.

 Death was in that poisonous wave, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And in its gulf a fitting grave 
For him who thence could solace bring 
To his lone imaginingWhose 
solitary soul could make 
An Eden of that dim lake. 




The Raven 

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, 
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, 
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, 
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. 
''Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber doorOnly 
this, and nothing more.'

 Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,

 And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow 
From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name LenoreNameless 
here for evermore.

 And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain

 Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; 
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, 
''Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door


Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;This 
it is, and nothing more.'

 Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,

 'Sir,' said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; 
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, 
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,

 That I scarce was sure I heard you'- here I opened wide the door;Darkness 
there, and nothing more.

 Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, 
fearing,

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; 
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, 
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore!'

 This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, 'Lenore!'Merely 
this, and nothing more.

 Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, 
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. 
'Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice: 



 Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery exploreLet 
my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;'
Tis the wind and nothing more.'

 Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and 
flutter, 
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; 
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed 
he; 
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber doorPerched 
upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber doorPerched, 
and sat, and nothing more.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, 
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore. 
'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no 
craven, 
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shoreTell 
me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!' 
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'

 Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,

 Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore; 
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being 
Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door


Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, 
With such name as 'Nevermore.'

 But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only

 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. 
Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he flutteredTill 
I scarcely more than muttered, 'other friends have flown

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 beforeOn 
the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.' 
Then the bird said, 'Nevermore.'

 Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,

 'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store, 
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster 
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore


Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore 
Of 'Never- nevermore'.' 



 But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, 
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and

 door; 
Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking 
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore


What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Meant in croaking 'Nevermore.'

 This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing

 To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; 
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining 
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,

 But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er, 
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

 Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer 
Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor. 
'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he 
hath sent thee 
Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore! 
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!' 
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'

 'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or 
devil!


Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, 
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchantedOn 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore


Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!' 
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'

 'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or 
devil!

 By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adoreTell 
this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, 
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore


Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.' 
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'

 'Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,' I shrieked, 
upstarting-



 'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! 
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! 
Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my 
door!' 
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'

 And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting

 On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; 
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, 
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the

 floor; 
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor 
Shall be lifted- nevermore! 




The Sleeper 

At midnight, in the month of June, 
I stand beneath the mystic moon. 
An opiate vapor, dewy, dim, 
Exhales from out her golden rim, 
And, softly dripping, drop by drop, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Upon the quiet mountain top, 
Steals drowsily and musically 
Into the universal valley. 
The rosemary nods upon the grave; 
The lily lolls upon the wave; 
Wrapping the fog about its breast, 
The ruin molders into rest; 
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake 
A conscious slumber seems to take, 
And would not, for the world, awake. 
All Beauty sleeps!- and lo! where lies 
Irene, with her Destinies!

 O, lady bright! can it be rightThis 
window open to the night? 
The wanton airs, from the tree-top, 
Laughingly through the lattice dropThe 
bodiless airs, a wizard rout, 
Flit through thy chamber in and out, 
And wave the curtain canopy 
So fitfully- so fearfullyAbove 
the closed and fringed lid 
'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid, 
That, o'er the floor and down the wall, 
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear? 
Why and what art thou dreaming here? 
Sure thou art come O'er far-off seas, 
A wonder to these garden trees! 
Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress, 
Strange, above all, thy length of tress, 
And this all solemn silentness!

 The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, 



 Which is enduring, so be deep! 
Heaven have her in its sacred keep! 
This chamber changed for one more holy, 
This bed for one more melancholy, 
I pray to God that she may lie 
For ever with unopened eye, 
While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!

 My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep 
As it is lasting, so be deep! 
Soft may the worms about her creep! 
Far in the forest, dim and old, 
For her may some tall vault unfoldSome 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
vault that oft has flung its black 
And winged panels fluttering back, 
Triumphant, o'er the crested palls, 
Of her grand family funeralsSome 
sepulchre, remote, alone, 
Against whose portal she hath thrown, 
In childhood, many an idle stoneSome 
tomb from out whose sounding door 
She ne'er shall force an echo more, 
Thrilling to think, poor child of sin! 
It was the dead who groaned within. 




The Valley Of Unrest 

Once it smiled a silent dell 
Where the people did not dwell; 
They had gone unto the wars, 
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars, 
Nightly, from their azure towers, 
To keep watch above the flowers, 
In the midst of which all day 
The red sunlight lazily lay. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Now each visitor shall confess 
The sad valley's restlessness. 
Nothing there is motionlessNothing 
save the airs that brood 
Over the magic solitude. 
Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees 
That palpitate like the chill seas 
Around the misty Hebrides! 
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven 
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven 
Uneasily, from morn till even, 
Over the violets there that lie 
In myriad types of the human eyeOver 
the lilies there that wave 
And weep above a nameless grave! 
They wave:- from out their fragrant tops 
Eternal dews come down in drops. 
They weep:- from off their delicate stems 
Perennial tears descend in gems. 




The Village Street

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 In these rapid, restless shadows, 
Once I walked at eventide, 
When a gentle, silent maiden,

 Walked in beauty at my side. 
She alone there walked beside me 
All in beauty, like a bride. 
Pallidly the moon was shining

 On the dewy meadows nigh; 
On the silvery, silent rivers, 
On the mountains far and high,-On 
the ocean's star-lit waters, 
Where the winds a-weary die.

 Slowly, silently we wandered 
From the open cottage door, 
Underneath the elm's long branches 
To the pavement bending o'er; 
Underneath the mossy willow 
And the dying sycamore.

 With the myriad stars in beauty 
All bedight, the heavens were seen, 
Radiant hopes were bright around me, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Like the light of stars serene; 
Like the mellow midnight splendor 
Of the Night's irradiate queen.

 Audibly the elm-leaves whispered 
Peaceful, pleasant melodies, 
Like the distant murmured music 
Of unquiet, lovely seas; 
While the winds were hushed in slumber 
In the fragrant flowers and trees.

 Wondrous and unwonted beauty 
Still adorning all did seem, 
While I told my love in fables 
'Neath the willows by the stream; 
Would the heart have kept unspoken 



 Love that was its rarest dream!

 Instantly away we wandered 
In the shadowy twilight tide, 
She, the silent, scornful maiden, 
Walking calmly at my side, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
With a step serene and stately, 
All in beauty, all in pride.

 Vacantly I walked beside her. 
On the earth mine eyes were cast; 
Swift and keen there came unto me 
Bitter memories of the past-On 
me, like the rain in Autumn 
On the dead leaves, cold and fast.

 Underneath the elms we parted, 
By the lowly cottage door; 
One brief word alone was uttered-


Never on our lips before; 
And away I walked forlornly, 
Broken-hearted evermore.

 Slowly, silently I loitered, 
Homeward, in the night, alone; 
Sudden anguish bound my spirit, 
That my youth had never known; 
Wild unrest, like that which cometh 
When the Night's first dream hath flown.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper 
Mad, discordant melodies, 
And keen melodies like shadows 
Haunt the moaning willow trees, 
And the sycamores with laughter 
Mock me in the nightly breeze.

 Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight 
Through the sighing foliage streams; 
And each morning, midnight shadow, 
Shadow of my sorrow seems; 
Strive, O heart, forget thine idol! 



 And, O soul, forget thy dreams! 



To -


The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see 
The wantonest singing birds, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Are lips- and all thy melody 
Of lip-begotten words


Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined, 
Then desolately fall, 
O God! on my funereal mind 
Like starlight on a pall


Thy heart- thy heart!- I wake and sigh, 
And sleep to dream till day 
Of the truth that gold can never buyOf 
the baubles that it may. 




To -- -


Not long ago, the writer of these lines, 
In the mad pride of intellectuality, 
Maintained "the power of words"- denied that ever 
A thought arose within the human brain 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue: 
And now, as if in mockery of that boast, 
Two words- two foreign soft dissyllablesItalian 
tones, made only to be murmured 
By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew 
That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill," 
Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart, 
Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought, 
Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions 
Than even seraph harper, Israfel, 
(Who has "the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,") 
Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken. 
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand. 
With thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee, 
I cannot write- I cannot speak or thinkAlas, 
I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling, 
This standing motionless upon the golden 
Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams. 
Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista, 
And thrilling as I see, upon the right, 
Upon the left, and all the way along, 
Amid empurpled vapors, far away 
To where the prospect terminates- thee only.

To -- -- --. Ulalume: A Ballad 

The skies they were ashen and sober; 
The leaves they were crisped and sereThe 
leaves they were withering and sere;

 It was night in the lonesome October 
Of my most immemorial year; 
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber, 
In the misty mid region of WeirIt 
was down by the dank tarn of Auber, 
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

 Here once, through an alley Titanic, 
Of cypress, I roamed with my SoulOf 
cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.

 There were days when my heart was volcanic 
As the scoriac rivers that rollAs 
the lavas that restlessly roll

 Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek 
In the ultimate climes of the poleThat 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek 
In the realms of the boreal pole.

 Our talk had been serious and sober, 
But our thoughts they were palsied and sereOur 
memories were treacherous and sere


For we knew not the month was October, 
And we marked not the night of the year(
Ah, night of all nights in the year!)

 We noted not the dim lake of Auber(
Though once we had journeyed down here), 
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber, 
Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

 And now, as the night was senescent, 
And star-dials pointed to mornAs 
the star-dials hinted of morn


At the end of our path a liquescent 
And nebulous lustre was born, 
Out of which a miraculous crescent 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Arose with a duplicate horn-



 Astarte's bediamonded crescent 
Distinct with its duplicate horn.

 And I said- 'She is warmer than Dian: 
She rolls through an ether of sighsShe 
revels in a region of sighs:

 She has seen that the tears are not dry on 
These cheeks, where the worm never dies,

 And has come past the stars of the Lion, 
To point us the path to the skiesTo 
the Lethean peace of the skies


Come up, in despite of the Lion, 
To shine on us with her bright eyesCome 
up through the lair of the Lion, 
With love in her luminous eyes.'

 But Psyche, uplifting her finger, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Said- 'Sadly this star I mistrustHer 
pallor I strangely mistrust:


Oh, hasten!- oh, let us not linger! 
Oh, fly!- let us fly!- for we must.' 
In terror she spoke, letting sink her 
Wings until they trailed in the dust


In agony sobbed, letting sink her 
Plumes till they trailed in the dustTill 
they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

 I replied- 'This is nothing but dreaming: 
Let us on by this tremulous light! 
Let us bathe in this crystalline light!

 Its Sybilic splendor is beaming 
With Hope and in Beauty to-night:See!- 
it flickers up the sky through the night!

 Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming, 
And be sure it will lead us aright

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

We safely may trust to a gleaming 
That cannot but guide us aright, 
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.'

 Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her, 
And tempted her out of her gloomAnd 
conquered her scruples and gloom; 



 And we passed to the end of the vista, 
But were stopped by the door of a tombBy 
the door of a legended tomb;

 And I said- 'What is written, sweet sister, 
On the door of this legended tomb?' 
She replied- 'Ulalume- Ulalume'
Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!'

 Then my heart it grew ashen and sober 
As the leaves that were crisped and sereAs 
the leaves that were withering and sere


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And I cried- 'It was surely October 
On this very night of last year 
That I journeyed- I journeyed down hereThat 
I brought a dread burden down hereOn 
this night of all nights in the year, 
Ah, what demon has tempted me here?

 Well I know, now, this dim lake of AuberThis 
misty mid region of WeirWell 
I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber, 
This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.' 




To F-


Beloved! amid the earnest woes

 That crowd around my earthly path(
Drear path, alas! where grows 
Not even one lonely rose)


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
My soul at least a solace hath 
In dreams of thee, and therein knows 
An Eden of bland repose.

 And thus thy memory is to me

 Like some enchanted far-off isle 
In some tumultuous seaSome 
ocean throbbing far and free

 With storms- but where meanwhile 
Serenest skies continually 
Just o'er that one bright island smile. 




To F--S S. O--D 

Thou wouldst be loved?- then let thy heart 
From its present pathway part not! 
Being everything which now thou art, 
Be nothing which thou art not. 
So with the world thy gentle ways, 
Thy grace, thy more than beauty, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Shall be an endless theme of praise, 
And love- a simple duty. 




To Helen 

Helen, thy beauty is to me 
Like those Nicean barks of yore, 
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea, 
The weary, wayworn wanderer bore 
To his own native shore.

 On desperate seas long wont to roam, 
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, 
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home

 To the glory that was Greece 
And the grandeur that was Rome.

 Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche 
How statue-like I see thee stand, 
The agate lamp within thy hand!

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 Ah, Psyche, from the regions which 
Are Holy Land! 




To Helen - 1848 

I saw thee once- once only- years ago: 
I must not say how many- but not many. 
It was a July midnight; and from out 
A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring, 
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven, 
There fell a silvery-silken veil of light, 
With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber, 
Upon the upturned faces of a thousand 
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden, 
Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe-
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses 
That gave out, in return for the love-light, 
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death-
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses 
That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted 
By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence. 
Clad all in white, upon a violet bank 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I saw thee half reclining; while the moon 
Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses, 
And on thine own, upturn'd- alas, in sorrow! 

Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight-
Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,) 
That bade me pause before that garden-gate, 
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses? 
No footstep stirred: the hated world an slept, 
Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!- oh, God! 
How my heart beats in coupling those two words!) 
Save only thee and me. I paused- I looked-
And in an instant all things disappeared. 
(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!) 

The pearly lustre of the moon went out: 
The mossy banks and the meandering paths, 
The happy flowers and the repining trees, 
Were seen no more: the very roses' odors 
Died in the arms of the adoring airs. 
All- all expired save thee- save less than thou: 
Save only the divine light in thine eyes-



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes. 
I saw but them- they were the world to me! 
I saw but them- saw only them for hours, 
Saw only them until the moon went down. 
What wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten 
Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres! 
How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope! 
How silently serene a sea of pride! 
How daring an ambition; yet how deep-
How fathomless a capacity for love! 

But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight, 
Into a western couch of thunder-cloud; 
And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees 
Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained; 
They would not go- they never yet have gone; 
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night, 
They have not left me (as my hopes have) since; 
They follow me- they lead me through the years. 
They are my ministers- yet I their slave. 
Their office is to illumine and enkindle-
My duty, to be saved by their bright light, 
And purified in their electric fire, 
And sanctified in their elysian fire. 
They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope), 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And are far up in Heaven- the stars I kneel to 
In the sad, silent watches of my night; 
While even in the meridian glare of day 
I see them still- two sweetly scintillant 
Venuses, unextinguished by the sun! 




To Isadore 

I. Beneath the vine-clad eaves, 
Whose shadows fall before 
Thy lowly cottage door-Under 
the lilac's tremulous leaves-Within 
thy snowy clasped hand

 The purple flowers it bore. 
Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand, 
Like queenly nymph from Fairy-land-Enchantress 
of the flowery wand,

 Most beauteous Isadore! 

II. And when I bade the dream 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Upon thy spirit flee, 
Thy violet eyes to me 
Upturned, did overflowing seem 
With the deep, untold delight

 Of Love's serenity; 
Thy classic brow, like lilies white 
And pale as the Imperial Night 
Upon her throne, with stars bedight,

 Enthralled my soul to thee! 

III. Ah! ever I behold 
Thy dreamy, passionate eyes, 
Blue as the languid skies 
Hung with the sunset's fringe of gold; 
Now strangely clear thine image grows,

 And olden memories 
Are startled from their long repose 
Like shadows on the silent snows 
When suddenly the night-wind blows

 Where quiet moonlight lies. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
IV. Like music heard in dreams, 
Like strains of harps unknown, 
Of birds for ever flown,-Audible 
as the voice of streams 



 That murmur in some leafy dell,

 I hear thy gentlest tone, 
And Silence cometh with her spell 
Like that which on my tongue doth dwell, 
When tremulous in dreams I tell

 My love to thee alone! 

V. In every valley heard, 
Floating from tree to tree, 
Less beautiful to me, 
The music of the radiant bird, 
Than artless accents such as thine

 Whose echoes never flee! 
Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:-For 
uttered in thy tones benign 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
(Enchantress!) this rude name of mine

 Doth seem a melody! 




To M-


O! I care not that my earthly lot 
Hath little of Earth in it, 
That years of love have been forgot 
In the fever of a minute:

 I heed not that the desolate 
Are happier, sweet, than I, 
But that you meddle with my fate 
Who am a passer by.

 It is not that my founts of bliss 
Are gushing- strange! with tearsOr 
that the thrill of a single kiss 
Hath palsied many years

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

'Tis not that the flowers of twenty springs 
Which have wither'd as they rose 
Lie dead on my heart-strings 
With the weight of an age of snows.

 Not that the grass- O! may it thrive! 
On my grave is growing or grownBut 
that, while I am dead yet alive 
I cannot be, lady, alone. 




To M.L.S. 

Of all who hail thy presence as the morningOf 
all to whom thine absence is the nightThe 
blotting utterly from out high heaven 
The sacred sun- of all who, weeping, bless thee 
Hourly for hope- for life- ah! above all, 
For the resurrection of deep-buried faith 
In Truth- in Virtue- in HumanityOf 
all who, on Despair's unhallowed bed 
Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
At thy soft-murmured words, "Let there be light!" 
At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled 
In the seraphic glancing of thine eyesOf 
all who owe thee most- whose gratitude 
Nearest resembles worship- oh, remember 
The truest- the most fervently devoted, 
And think that these weak lines are written by himBy 
him who, as he pens them, thrills to think 
His spirit is communing with an angel's. 




To Marie Louise (Shew) 

Of all who hail thy presence as the morning-
Of all to whom thine absence is the night-
The blotting utterly from out high heaven 
The sacred sun- of all who, weeping, bless thee 
Hourly for hope- for life- ah! above all, 
For the resurrection of deep-buried faith 
In Truth- in Virtue- in Humanity-
Of all who, on Despair's unhallowed bed 
Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen 
At thy soft-murmured words, 'Let there be light!' 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled 
In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes-
Of all who owe thee most- whose gratitude 
Nearest resembles worship- oh, remember 
The truest- the most fervently devoted, 
And think that these weak lines are written by him-
By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think 
His spirit is communing with an angel's. 




To My Mother 

Because I feel that, in the Heavens above, 
The angels, whispering to one another, 
Can find, among their burning terms of love, 
None so devotional as that of "Mother," 
Therefore by that dear name I long have called youYou 
who are more than mother unto me, 
And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you 
In setting my Virginia's spirit free. 
My mother- my own mother, who died early, 
Was but the mother of myself; but you 
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew 
By that infinity with which my wife 
Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life. 




To One Departed 

Seraph! thy memory is to me 
Like some enchanted far-off isle 
In some tumultuous sea Some 
ocean vexed as it may be 
With storms; but where, meanwhile, 
Serenest skies continually 
Just o'er that one bright island smile. 
For 'mid the earnest cares and woes 
That crowd around my earthly path, 
(Sad path, alas, where grows 
Not even one lonely rose!) 
My soul at least a solace hath 
In dreams of thee; and therein knows 
An Eden of bland repose. 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


To One In Paradise 

Thou wast all that to me, love, 
For which my soul did pineA 
green isle in the sea, love, 
A fountain and a shrine, 
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers, 
And all the flowers were mine.

 Ah, dream too bright to last! 
Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise 
But to be overcast! 
A voice from out the Future cries, 
'On! on!'- but o'er the Past 
(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies 
Mute, motionless, aghast!

 For, alas! alas! me 
For me the light of Life is over! 
'No more- no more- no more-'

 (Such language holds the solemn sea 
To the sands upon the shore) 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree 
Or the stricken eagle soar!

 And all my days are trances, 
And all my nightly dreams 
Are where thy grey eye glances, 
And where thy footstep gleamsIn 
what ethereal dances, 
By what eternal streams. 




To The River -


Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow 
Of crystal, wandering water, 
Thou art an emblem of the glow 
Of beauty- the unhidden heartThe 
playful maziness of art 
In old Alberto's daughter;

 But when within thy wave she looksWhich 
glistens then, and tremblesWhy, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
then, the prettiest of brooks 
Her worshipper resembles; 
For in his heart, as in thy stream, 
Her image deeply liesHis 
heart which trembles at the beam 
Of her soul-searching eyes. 




Ulalume 

The skies they were ashen and sober; 
The leaves they were crisped and sere The 
leaves they were withering and sere; 
It was night in the lonesome October 
Of my most immemorial year; 
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber, 
In the misty mid region of Weir It 
was down by the dank tarn of Auber, 
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir. 

Here once, through an alley Titanic, 
Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul Of 
cypress, with Psyche, my Soul. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
These were days when my heart was volcanic 
As the scoriac rivers that roll As 
the lavas that restlessly roll 
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek 
In the ultimate climes of the pole That 
groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek 
In the realms of the boreal pole. 

Our talk had been serious and sober, 
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere Our 
memories were treacherous and sere, For 
we knew not the month was October, 
And we marked not the night of the year (
Ah, night of all nights in the year!) 
We noted not the dim lake of Auber (
Though once we had journey down here), 
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber, 
Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir. 

And now, as the night was senescent, 
And star-dials pointed to morn As 
the star-dials hinted of morn At 
the end of our path a liquescent 
And nebulous lustre was born, 
Out of which a miraculous crescent 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Arose with a duplicate horn 




Astarte's bediamonded crescent 
Distinct with its duplicate horn. 

And I said - "She is warmer than Dian: 
She rolls through an ether of sighs She 
revels in a region of sighs: 
She has seen that the tears are not dry on 
These cheeks, where the worm never dies, 
And has come past the stars of the Lion 
To point us the path to the skies To 
the Lethean peace of the skies Come 
up, in despite of the Lion, 
To shine on us with her bright eyes Come 
up through the lair of the Lion, 
With love in her luminous eyes." 

But Psyche, uplifting her finger, 
Said - "Sadly this star I mistrust Her 
pallor I strangely mistrust: Oh, 
hasten! - oh, let us not linger! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Oh, fly! - let us fly! - for we must." 
In terror she spoke, letting sink her 
Wings until they trailed in the dust In 
agony sobbed, letting sink her 
Plumes till they trailed in the dust Till 
they sorrowfully trailed in the dust. 

I replied - "This is nothing but dreaming: 
Let us on by this tremulous light! 
Let us bathe in this crystalline light! 
Its Sybilic splendor is beaming 
With Hope and in Beauty to-night! See! 
- it flickers up the sky through the night! 
Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming, 
And be sure it will lead us aright We 
safely may trust to a gleaming, 
That cannot but guide us aright, 
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night." 

Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her, 
And tempted her out of her gloom And 
conquered her scruples and gloom; 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And we passed to the end of the vista, 
But were stopped by the door of a tomb By 
the door of a legended tomb; 
And I said - "What is written, sweet sister, 
On the door of this legended tomb?" 
She replied - "Ulalume - Ulalume ‘
Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!" 

Then my heart it grew ashen and sober 
As the leaves that were crisped and sere As 
the leaves that were withering and sere, 
And I cried - "It was surely October 
On this very night of last year 
That I journeyed - I journeyed down here That 
I brought a dread burden down here! 
On this night of all nights in the year, 
Ah, what demon has tempted me here? 
Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber This 
misty mid region of Weir Well 
I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber, This 
ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir."

[four Sonnets (1922)] 

I1. 
Love, though for this you riddle me with darts, 
. 
And drag me at your chariot till I die, -. 
Oh, heavy prince! Oh, panderer of hearts! -. 
Yet hear me tell how in their throats they lie 
. 
Who shout you mighty: thick about my hair, 
. 
Day in, day out, your ominous arrows purr, 
. 
Who still am free, unto no querulous care 
. 
A fool, and in no temple worshiper! 
. 
I, that have bared me to your quiver's fire, 
.

 Lifted my face into its puny rain, 
.

 Do wreathe you Impotent to Evoke Desire 
.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 As you are Powerless to Elicit Pain! 
.

 (Now will the god, for blasphemy so brave, 
.

 Punish me, surely, with the shaft I crave!) II2. 
I think I should have loved you presently, 
. 
And given in earnest words I flung in jest; 
. 
And lifted honest eyes for you to see, 
. 



 And caught your hand against my cheek and breast; 
. 
And all my pretty follies flung aside 
. 
That won you to me, and beneath your gaze, 
. 
Naked of reticence and shorn of pride, 
. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Spread like a chart my little wicked ways. 
. 
I, that had been to you, had you remained, 
.

 But one more waking from a recurrent dream, 
.

 Cherish no less the certain stakes I gained, 
.

 And walk your memory's halls, austere, supreme, 
.

 A ghost in marble of a girl you knew 
.

 Who would have loved you in a day or two. III3. 
Oh, think not I am faithful to a vow! 
. 
Faithless am I save to love's self alone. 
. 
Were you not lovely I would leave you now: 
. 
After the feet of beauty fly my own. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
. 
Were you not still my hunger's rarest food, 
. 
And water ever to my wildest thirst, 
. 
I would desert you -- think not but I would! -. 
And seek another as I sought you first. 
. 



 But you are mobile as the veering air, 
.

 And all your charms more changeful than the tide, 
.

 Wherefore to be inconstant is no care: 
.

 I have but to continue at your side. 
.

 So wanton, light and false, my love, are you, 
.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 I am most faithless when I most am true. IV4. 
I shall forget you presently, my dear, 
. 
So make the most of this, your little day, 
. 
Your little month, your little half a year, 
. 
Ere I forget, or die, or move away, 
. 
And we are done forever; by and by 
. 
I shall forget you, as I said, but now, 
. 
If you entreat me with your loveliest lie 
. 
I will protest you with my favorite vow. 
. 
I would indeed that love were longer-lived, 
.

 And vows were not so brittle as they are, 
.

 But so it is, and nature has contrived 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
.

 To struggle on without a break thus far, -




.

 Whether or not we find what we are seeking 
.

 Is idle, biologically speaking. 



A Visit To The Asylum 

Once from a big, big building, 
When I was small, small, 
The queer folk in the windows 
Would smile at me and call. 

And in the hard wee gardens 
Such pleasant men would hoe: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
"Sir, may we touch the little girl's hair!" 
It was so red, you know. 

They cut me coloured asters 
With shears so sharp and neat, 
They brought me grapes and plums and pears 
And pretty cakes to eat. 

And out of all the windows, 
No matter where we went, 
The merriest eyes would follow me 
And make me compliment. 

There were a thousand windows, 
All latticed up and down. 
And up to all the windows, 
When we went back to town, 

The queer folk put their faces, 
As gentle as could be; 
"Come again, little girl!" they called, and I 
Called back, "You come see me!" 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Afternoon On A Hill 

I will be the gladdest thing 
Under the sun! 
I will touch a hundred flowers 
And not pick one. 

I will look at cliffs and clouds 
With quiet eyes, 
Watch the wind bow down the grass, 
And the grass rise. 

And when lights begin to show 
Up from the town, 
I will mark which must be mine, 
And then start down! 




Alms 

My heart is what it was before, 
A house where people come and go; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But it is winter with your love, 
The sashes are beset with snow. 

I light the lamp and lay the cloth, 
I blow the coals to blaze again; 
But it is winter with your love, 
The frost is thick upon the pane.. 

I know a winter when it comes: 
The leaves are listless on the boughs; 
I watched your love a little while, 
And brought my plants into the house. 

I water them and turn them south, 
I snap the dead brown from the stem; 
But it is winter with your love, 
I only tend and water them. 

There was a time I stood and watched 
The small, ill-natured sparrows' fray; 
I loved the beggar that I fed, 
I cared for what he had to say, 

I stood and watched him out of sight: 
Today I reach around the door 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And set a bowl upon the step; 
My heart is what it was before, 

But it is winter with your love; 
I scatter crumbs upon the sill, 
And close the window, and the birds 
May take or leave them, as they will. 




An Ancient Gesture 

I thought, as I wiped my eyes on the corner of my apron: 
Penelope did this too. 
And more than once: you can't keep weaving all day 
And undoing it all through the night; 
Your arms get tired, and the back of your neck gets tight; 
And along towards morning, when you think it will never be light, 
And your husband has been gone, and you don't know where, for years. 
Suddenly you burst into tears; 
There is simply nothing else to do. 

And I thought, as I wiped my eyes on the corner of my apron: 
This is an ancient gesture, authentic, antique, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In the very best tradition, classic, Greek; 
Ulysses did this too. 
But only as a gesture,a gesture which implied 
To the assembled throng that he was much too moved to speak. 
He learned it from Penelope... 
Penelope, who really cried. 




And Do You Think That Love Itself 

And do you think that love itself, 
Living in such an ugly house, 
Can prosper long?

	We meet and part; 
Our talk is all of heres and nows, 
Our conduct likewise; in no act 
Is any future, any past; 
Under our sly, unspoken pact, 
I KNOW with whom I saw you last, 
But I say nothing; and you know 
At six-fifteen to whom I go 
Can even love be treated so? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

I KNOW, but I do not insist, 
Having stealth and tact, thought not enough, 
What hour your eye is on your wrist. 

No wild appeal, no mild rebuff 
Deflates the hour, leaves the wine flat 

Yet if YOU drop the picked-up book 
To intercept my clockward look 
Tell me, can love go on like that? 

Even the bored, insulted heart, 
That signed so long and tight a lease, 
Can BREAK it CONTRACT, slump in peace. 




And You As Well Must Die, Belovèd Dust 

And you as well must die, belovèd dust, 
And all your beauty stand you in no stead; 
This flawless, vital hand, this perfect head, 
This body of flame and steel, before the gust 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of Death, or under his autumnal frost, 
Shall be as any leaf, be no less dead 
Than the first leaf that fell,this wonder fled, 
Altered, estranged, disintegrated, lost. 
Nor shall my love avail you in your hour. 
In spite of all my love, you will arise 
Upon that day and wander down the air 
Obscurely as the unattended flower, 
It mattering not how beautiful you were, 
Or how belovèd above all else that dies. 




Apostrophe To Man 

(On reflecting that the world 
is ready to go to war again) 

Detestable race, continue to expunge yourself, die out. 
Breed faster, crowd, encroach, sing hymns, build 
bombing airplanes; 
Make speeches, unveil statues, issue bonds, parade; 
Convert again into explosives the bewildered ammonia 
and the distracted cellulose; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Convert again into putrescent matter drawing flies 
The hopeful bodies of the young; exhort, 
Pray, pull long faces, be earnest, 
be all but overcome, be photographed; 
Confer, perfect your formulae, commercialize 
Bacateria harmful to human tissue, 
Put death on the market; 
Breed, crowd, encroach, 
expand, expunge yourself, die out, 
Homo called sapiens. 




Ashes Of Life 

Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike; 
Eat I must, and sleep I will,and would that night were 
here! 
But ah!to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike! 
Would that it were day again!with twilight near! 

Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to do; 
This or that or what you will is all the same to me; 
But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
There's little use in anything as far as I can see. 

Love has gone and left me,and the neighbors knock and 
borrow, 
And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse, 
And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow 
There's this little street and this little house. 




Assault 

I 

I had forgotten how the frogs must sound 
After a year of silence, else I think 
I should not so have ventured forth alone 
At dusk upon this unfrequented road. 

II 

I am waylaid by Beauty. Who will walk 
Between me and the crying of the frogs? 
Oh, savage Beauty, suffer me to pass, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That am a timid woman, on her way 
From one house to another! 




Autumn Daybreak 

Cold wind of autumn, blowing loud 
At dawn, a fortnight overdue, 
Jostling the doors, and tearing through 
My bedroom to rejoin the cloud, 
I knowfor I can hear the hiss 
And scrape of leaves along the floor 
How may boughs, lashed bare by this, 
Will rake the cluttered sky once more. 
Tardy, and somewhat south of east, 
The sun will rise at length, made known 
More by the meagre light increased 
Than by a disk in splendour shown; 
When, having but to turn my head, 
Through the stripped maple I shall see, 
Bleak and remembered, patched with red, 
The hill all summer hid from me. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>



Being Young And Green 

Being Young and Green, I said in love's despite: 
Never in the world will I to living wight 
Give over, air my mind 
To anyone, 
Hang out its ancient secrets in the strong wind 
To be shredded and faded 

Oh, me, invaded 
And sacked by the wind and the sun! 




Blight 

Hard seeds of hate I planted 
That should by now be grown, 
Rough stalks, and from thick stamens 
A poisonous pollen blown, 
And odors rank, unbreathable, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
From dark corollas thrown! 

At dawn from my damp garden 
I shook the chilly dew; 
The thin boughs locked behind me 
That sprang to let me through; 
The blossoms slept,I sought a place 
Where nothing lovely grew. 

And there, when day was breaking, 
I knelt and looked around: 
The light was near, the silence 
Was palpitant with sound; 
I drew my hate from out my breast

 And thrust it in the ground. 

Oh, ye so fiercely tended, 
Ye little seeds of hate! 
I bent above your growing 
Early and noon and late, 
Yet are ye drooped and pitiful, 
I cannot rear ye straight! 

The sun seeks out my garden, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
No nook is left in shade, 
No mist nor mold nor mildew 
Endures on any blade, 
Sweet rain slants under every bough: 
Ye falter, and ye fade. 




Bluebeard 

This door you might not open, and you did; 
So enter now, and see for what slight thing 
You are betrayed... Here is no treasure hid, 
No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring 
The sought-for truth, no heads of women slain 

For greed like yours, no writhings of distress, 
But only what you see... Look yet again 
An empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless. 

Yet this alone out of my life I kept 
Unto myself, lest any know me quite; 
And you did so profane me when you crept 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Unto the threshold of this room to-night 
That I must never more behold your face. 
This now is yours. I seek another place. 




Burial 

Mine is a body that should die at sea! 
And have for a grave, instead of a grave 
Six feet deep and the length of me, 
All the water that is under the wave! 
And terrible fishes to seize my flesh, 
Such as a living man might fear, 
And eat me while I am firm and fresh, 
Not wait till I've been dead for a year! 




Childhood Is The Kingdom Where Nobody Dies 

Childhood is not from birth to a certain age and at a certain age 
The child is grown, and puts away childish things. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies. 

Nobody that matters, that is. Distant relatives of course 
Die, whom one never has seen or has seen for an hour, 
And they gave one candy in a pink-and-green stripéd bag, or a jack-knife, 
And went away, and cannot really be said to have lived at all. 

And cats die. They lie on the floor and lash their tails, 
And their reticent fur is suddenly all in motion 
With fleas that one never knew were there, 
Polished and brown, knowing all there is to know, 
Trekking off into the living world. 
You fetch a shoe-box, but it's much too small, because she won't curl up now: 
So you find a bigger box, and bury her in the yard, and weep. 
But you do not wake up a month from then, two months 
A year from then, two years, in the middle of the night 
And weep, with your knuckles in your mouth, and say Oh, God! Oh, God! 
Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies that matters, 
—mothers and fathers don't die. 

And if you have said, "For heaven's sake, must you always be kissing a 
person?" 
Or, "I do wish to gracious you'd stop tapping on the window with your 
thimble!" 
Tomorrow, or even the day after tomorrow if you're busy having fun, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Is plenty of time to say, "I'm sorry, mother." 

To be grown up is to sit at the table with people who have died, 
who neither listen nor speak; 
Who do not drink their tea, though they always said 
Tea was such a comfort. 

Run down into the cellar and bring up the last jar of raspberries; 
they are not tempted. 
Flatter them, ask them what was it they said exactly 
That time, to the bishop, or to the overseer, or to Mrs. Mason; 
They are not taken in. 



Shout at them, get red in the face, rise, 
Drag them up out of their chairs by their stiff shoulders and shake 
them and yell at them; 
They are not startled, they are not even embarrassed; they slide 
back into their chairs. 

Your tea is cold now. 
You drink it standing up, 
And leave the house. 

<|endoftext|>

Chorus 

Give away her gowns, 
Give away her shoes; 
She has no more use 
For her fragrant gowns; 
Take them all down, 
Blue, green, blue, 
Lilac, pink, blue, 
From their padded hangers; 
She will dance no more 
In her narrow shoes; 
Sweep her narrow shoes 
From the closet floor. 




City Trees 

The trees along this city street, 
Save for the traffic and the trains, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Would make a sound as thin and sweet 
As trees in country lanes. 

And people standing in their shade 
Out of a shower, undoubtedly 
Would hear such music as is made 
Upon a country tree. 

Oh, little leaves that are so dumb 
Against the shrieking city air, 
I watch you when the wind has come, 
I know what sound is there. 




Conscientious Objector 

I shall die, but 
that is all that I shall do for Death. 
I hear him leading his horse out of the stall; 
I hear the clatter on the barn-floor. 
He is in haste; he has business in Cuba, 
business in the Balkans, many calls to make this morning. 
But I will not hold the bridle 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
while he clinches the girth. 
And he may mount by himself: 
I will not give him a leg up. 

Though he flick my shoulders with his whip, 
I will not tell him which way the fox ran. 
With his hoof on my breast, I will not tell him where 
the black boy hides in the swamp. 
I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death; 
I am not on his pay-roll. 

I will not tell him the whereabout of my friends 
nor of my enemies either. 
Though he promise me much, 
I will not map him the route to any man's door. 
Am I a spy in the land of the living, 
that I should deliver men to Death? 
Brother, the password and the plans of our city 
are safe with me; never through me Shall you be overcome. 




Counting-Out Rhyme 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Silver bark of beech, and sallow 
Bark of yellow birch and yellow 
Twig of willow. 

Stripe of green in moosewood maple, 
Colour seen in leaf of apple, 
Bark of popple. 

Wood of popple pale as moonbeam, 
Wood of oak for yoke and barn-beam, 
Wood of hornbeam. 

Silver bark of beech, and hollow 
Stem of elder, tall and yellow 
Twig of willow. 




Daphne 

Why do you follow me? 
Any moment I can be 
Nothing but a laurel-tree. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Any moment of the chase 
I can leave you in my place 
A pink bough for your embrace. 

Yet if over hill and hollow 
Still it is your will to follow, 
I am off;to heel, Apollo! 




Departure 

It's little I care what path I take, 
And where it leads it's little I care; 
But out of this house, lest my heart break, 
I must go, and off somewhere. 

It's little I know what's in my heart, 
What's in my mind it's little I know, 
But there's that in me must up and start, 
And it's little I care where my feet go. 

I wish I could walk for a day and a night, 
And find me at dawn in a desolate place 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
With never the rut of a road in sight, 
Nor the roof of a house, nor the eyes of a face. 

I wish I could walk till my blood should spout, 
And drop me, never to stir again, 
On a shore that is wide, for the tide is out, 
And the weedy rocks are bare to the rain. 

But dump or dock, where the path I take 
Brings up, it's little enough I care: 
And it's little I'd mind the fuss they'll make, 
Huddled dead in a ditch somewhere. 

'Is something the matter, dear,' she said, 
'That you sit at your work so silently?' 
'No, mother, no, 'twas a knot in my thread. 
There goes the kettle, I'll make the tea.' 




Dirge 

Boys and girls that held her dear, 
Do your weeping now; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
All you loved of her lies here. 

Brought to earth the arrogant brow, 
And the withering tongue 
Chastened; do your weeping now. 

Sing whatever songs are sung, 
Wind whatever wreath, 
For a playmate perished young, 

For a spirit spent in death. 
Boys and girls that held her dear, 
All you loved of her lies here. 




Dirge Without Music 

I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground. 
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind: 
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned 
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned. 

Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust. 
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew, 
A formula, a phrase remains,but the best is lost. 

The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the 
love, 
They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled 
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not 
approve. 
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the 
world. 

Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave 
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind; 
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave. 
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned. 




Doubt No More That Oberon 

Doubt no more that Oberon 
Never doubt that Pan 
Lived, and played a reed, and ran 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
After nymphs in a dark forest, 
In the merry, credulous days, 
Lived, and led a fairy band 
Over the indulgent land! 
Ah, for in this dourest, sorest 
Age man's eye has looked upon, 
Death to fauns and death to fays, 
Still the dog-wood dares to raise 
Healthy tree, with trunk and root 
Ivory bowls that bear no fruit, 
And the starlings and the jays 
Birds that cannot even sing 
Dare to come again in spring! 




Ebb 

I know what my heart is like 
Since your love died: 
It is like a hollow ledge 
Holding a little pool 
Left there by the tide, 
A little tepid pool, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Drying inward from the edge. 




Eel-Grass 

No matter what I say, 
All that I really love 
Is the rain that flattens on the bay, 
And the eel-grass in the cove; 
The jingle-shells that lie and bleach 
At the tide-line, and the trace 
Of higher tides along the beach: 
Nothing in this place. 




Elegy 

Let them bury your big eyes 
In the secret earth securely, 
Your thin fingers, and your fair, 
Soft, indefinite-colored hair, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
All of these in some way, surely, 
From the secret earth shall rise; 
Not for these I sit and stare, 
Broken and bereft completely; 
Your young flesh that sat so neatly 
On your little bones will sweetly 
Blossom in the air. 

But your voice,never the rushing 
Of a river underground, 
Not the rising of the wind 
In the trees before the rain, 
Not the woodcock's watery call, 
Not the note the white-throat utters, 
Not the feet of children pushing 
Yellow leaves along the gutters 
In the blue and bitter fall, 
Shall content my musing mind 
For the beauty of that sound 
That in no new way at all 
Ever will be heard again. 

Sweetly through the sappy stalk 
Of the vigorous weed, 
Holding all it held before, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Cherished by the faithful sun, 
On and on eternally 
Shall your altered fluid run, 
Bud and bloom and go to seed; 
But your singing days are done; 
But the music of your talk 
Never shall the chemistry 
Of the secret earth restore. 
All your lovely words are spoken. 
Once the ivory box is broken, 



Beats the golden bird no more. 



Elegy Before Death 

There will be rose and rhododendron 
When you are dead and under ground; 
Still will be heard from white syringas 
Heavy with bees, a sunny sound; 

Still will the tamaracks be raining 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
After the rain has ceased, and still 
Will there be robins in the stubble, 
Brown sheep upon the warm green hill. 

Spring will not ail nor autumn falter; 
Nothing will know that you are gone, 
Saving alone some sullen plough-land 
None but yourself sets foot upon; 

Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed 
Nothing will know that you are dead, 
These, and perhaps a useless wagon 
Standing beside some tumbled shed. 

Oh, there will pass with your great passing 
Little of beauty not your own, 
Only the light from common water, 
Only the grace from simple stone! 




Epitaph 

Heap not on this mound 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Roses that she loved so well: 
Why bewilder her with roses, 
That she cannot see or smell? 

She is happy where she lies 
With the dust upon her eyes. 




Euclid Alone 

Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare. 
Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace, 
And lay them prone upon the earth and cease 
To ponder on themselves, the while they stare 
At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere 
In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese 
Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release 
From dusty bondage into luminous air. 
O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, 
When first the shaft into his vision shone 
Of light anatomized! Euclid alone 
Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they 
Who, though once only and then but far away, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Have heard her massive sandal set on stone. 




Exiled 

Searching my heart for its true sorrow, 
This is the thing I find to be: 
That I am weary of words and people, 
Sick of the city, wanting the sea; 

Wanting the sticky, salty sweetness 
Of the strong wind and shattered spray; 
Wanting the loud sound and the soft sound 
Of the big surf that breaks all day. 

Always before about my dooryard, 
Marking the reach of the winter sea, 
Rooted in sand and dragging drift-wood, 
Straggled the purple wild sweet-pea; 

Always I climbed the wave at morning, 
Shook the sand from my shoes at night, 
That now am caught beneath great buildings, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Stricken with noise, confused with light. 

If I could hear the green piles groaning 
Under the windy wooden piers, 
See once again the bobbing barrels, 
And the black sticks that fence the weirs, 

If I could see the weedy mussels 
Crusting the wrecked and rotting hulls, 
Hear once again the hungry crying 
Overhead, of the wheeling gulls, 

Feel once again the shanty straining 
Under the turning of the tide, 
Fear once again the rising freshet, 
Dread the bell in the fog outside, 

I should be happy,that was happy 
All day long on the coast of Maine! 
I have a need to hold and handle 
Shells and anchors and ships again! 



I should be happy, that am happy 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Never at all since I came here. 
I am too long away from water. 
I have a need of water near. 




Feast 

I drank at every vine. 
The last was like the first. 
I came upon no wine 
So wonderful as thirst. 

I gnawed at every root. 
I ate of every plant. 
I came upon no fruit 
So wonderful as want. 

Feed the grape and bean 
To the vintner and monger: 
I will lie down lean 
With my thirst and my hunger. 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


First Fig 

My candle burns at both ends; 
It will not last the night; 
But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends— 
It gives a lovely light. 




Fontaine, Je Ne Boirai Pas De Ton Eau! 

I know I might have lived in such a way 

As to have suffered only pain: 

Loving not man nor dog; 

Not money, even; feeling 

Toothache perhaps, but never more than an hour away 

From skill and novocaine; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Making no contacts, dealing with life through Agents, drinking 
one cocktail, betting two dollars, wearing raincoats in the 
rain. 

Betrayed at length by no one but the fog 

Whispering to the wing of the plane. 

"Fountain," I have cried to that unbubbling well, "I will not 
drink of thy water!" Yet I thirst 

For a mouthful ofnot to swallow, only to rinse my mouth in 

peace. 

And while the eyes of the past condemn, 

The eyes of the present narrow into assignation. And 
worst 

The young are so old, they are born with their fingers crossed; 
I shall get no help from them. 


<|endoftext|>

God's World 

O world, I cannot hold thee close enough! 
Thy winds, thy wide grey skies! 
Thy mists that roll and rise! 
Thy woods this autumn day, that ache and sag 
And all but cry with colour! That gaunt crag 
To crush! To lift the lean of that black bluff! 
World, World, I cannot get thee close enough! 

Long have I known a glory in it all, 
But never knew I this; 
Here such a passion is 
As stretcheth me apart, -- Lord, I do fear 
Thou'st made the world too beautiful this year; 
My soul is all but out of me, -- let fall 
No burning leaf; prithee, let no bird call. 




Grown-Up

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 Was it for this I uttered prayers, 
And sobbed and cursed and kicked the stairs, 
That now, domestic as a plate, 
I should retire at half-past eight? 




Here Is A Wound That Never Will Heal, I Know 

Here is a wound that never will heal, I know, 
Being wrought not of a dearness and a death, 
But of a love turned ashes and the breath 
Gone out of beauty; never again will grow 
The grass on that scarred acre, though I sow 
Young seed there yearly and the sky bequeath 
Its friendly weathers down, far Underneath 
Shall be such bitterness of an old woe. 
That April should be shattered by a gust, 
That August should be levelled by a rain, 
I can endure, and that the lifted dust 
Of man should settle to the earth again; 
But that a dream can die, will be a thrust 
Between my ribs forever of hot pain. 

<|endoftext|>

Humoresque

 "Heaven bless the babe!" they said. 
"What queer books she must have read!" 
(Love, by whom I was beguiled, 
Grant I may not bear a child.) 
"Little does she guess to-day 
What the world may be!" they say. 
(Snow, drift deep and cover 
Till the spring my murdered lover.) 




I Do But Ask That You Be Always Fair 

I do but ask that you be always fair 
That I forever may continue kind; 
Knowing me what I am, you should not dare 
To lapse from beauty ever, nor seek to bind 
My alterable mood with lesser cords; 
Weeping and such soft matters must invite 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To further vagrancy; and bitter words 
Chafe soon to irremediable flight, 
Wherefore I pray you if you love me dearly, 
Less dear to hold me than your own bright charms, 
Whence it may fall that until death, or nearly, 
I shall not move to struggle from your arms: 
Fade if you must,--I would but bid you be 
Like the sweet year, doing all things graciously. 




I Dreamed I Moved Among The Elysian Fields 

I dreamed I moved among the Elysian fields, 
In converse with sweet women long since dead; 
And out of blossoms which that meadow yields 
I wove a garland for your living head. 
Danai, that was the vessel for a day 
Of golden Jove, I saw, and at her side, 
Whom Jove the Bull desired and bore away, 
Europa stood, and the Swan's featherless bride. 
All these were mortal women, yet all these 
Above the ground had had a god for guest; 
Freely I walked beside them and at ease, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Addressing them, by them again addressed, 
And marvelled nothing, for remembering you, 
Wherefore I was among them well I knew. 




I Know I Am But Summer To Your Heart 

I know I am but summer to your heart, 
And not the full four seasons of the year; 
And you must welcome from another part 
Such noble moods as are not mine, my dear. 
No gracious weight of golden fruits to sell 
Have I, nor any wise and wintry thing; 
And I have loved you all too long and well 
To carry still the high sweet breast of Spring. 
Wherefore I say: O love, as summer goes, 
I must be gone, steal forth with silent drums, 
That you may hail anew the bird and rose 
When I come back to you, as summer comes. 
Else will you seek, at some not distant time, 
Even your summer in another clime.

I Know The Face Of Falsehood And Her Tongue 

I know the face of Falsehood and her Tongue 
Honeyed with unction, Plausible with guile, 
Are dear to men, whom count me not among, 
That owe their daily credit to her smile; 
Such have been succoured out of great distress 
By her contriving, if accounts be true: 
Their deference now above the board, I guess, 
Dishcharges what beneath the board is due. 
As for myself, I'd liefer lack her aid 
Than eat her presence; let this building fall: 
But let me never lift my latch, afraid 
To hear her simpering accents in the hall, 
Nor force an entrance past mephitic airs 
Of stale patchoulie hanging on my stairs. 




I Shall Go Back 

I shall go back again to the bleak shore 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And build a little shanty on the sand 
In such a way that the extremest band 
Of brittle seaweed shall escape my door 
But by a yard or two; and nevermore 
Shall I return to take you by the hand. 
I shall be gone to what I understand, 
And happier than I ever was before. 
The love that stood a moment in your eyes, 
The words that lay a moment on your tongue, 
Are one with all that in a moment dies, 
A little under-said and over-sung. 
But I shall find the sullen rocks and skies 
Unchanged from what they were when I was young. 




I will put Chaos into fourteen lines 

I will put Chaos into fourteen lines 
And keep him there; and let him thence escape 
If he be lucky; let him twist, and ape 
Flood, fire, and demon — his adroit designs 
Will strain to nothing in the strict confines 
Of this sweet Order, where, in pious rape, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I hold his essence and amorphous shape, 
Till he with Order mingles and combines. 
Past are the hours, the years, of our duress, 
His arrogance, our awful servitude: 
I have him. He is nothing more nor less 
Than something simple not yet understood; 
I shall not even force him to confess; 
Or answer. I will only make him good. 




I, Being Born A Woman And Distressed 

I, being born a woman and distressed 
By all the needs and notions of my kind, 
Am urged by your propinquity to find 
Your person fair, and feel a certain zest 
To bear your body's weight upon my breast: 
So subtly is the fume of life designed, 
To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind, 
And leave me once again undone, possessed. 
Think not for this, however, the poor treason 
Of my stout blood against my staggering brain, 
I shall remember you with love, or season 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
My scorn wtih pity, -- let me make it plain: 
I find this frenzy insufficient reason 
For conversation when we meet again. 




If I Should Learn, In Some Quite Casual Way 

IF I should learn, in some quite casual way, 
That you were gone, not to return again 
Read from the back-page of a paper, say, 
Held by a neighbor in a subway train, 
How at the corner of this avenue 
And such a street (so are the papers filled) 
A hurrying manwho happened to be you 
At noon to-day had happened to be killed, 
I should not cry aloudI could not cry 
Aloud, or wring my hands in such a place 
I should but watch the station lights rush by 

With a more careful interest on my face, 
Or raise my eyes and read with greater care 
Where to store furs and how to treat the hair.

If Still Your Orchards Bear 

Brother, that breathe the August air 
Ten thousand years from now, 
And smellif still your orchards bear 
Tart apples on the bough 

The early windfall under the tree, 
And see the red fruit shine, 
I cannot think your thoughts will be 
Much different from mine. 

Should at that moment the full moon 
Step forth upon the hill, 
And memories hard to bear at noon, 
By moonlight harder still, 
Form in the shadow of the trees,  
Things that you could not spare 
And live, or so you thought, yet these 
All gone, and you still there, 

A man no longer what he was, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Nor yet the thing he'd planned, 
The chilly apple from the grass 
Warmed by your living hand 

I think you will have need of tears; 
I think they will not flow; 
Supposing in ten thousand years 
Men ache, as they do now. 




Indifference 

I said,for Love was laggard, O, Love was slow to come, 
"I'll hear his step and know his step when I am warm in 
bed; 
But I'll never leave my pillow, though there be some 
As would let him inand take him in with tears!" I said. 
I lay,for Love was laggard, O, he came not until dawn, 
I lay and listened for his step and could not get to sleep; 
And he found me at my window with my big cloak on, 
All sorry with the tears some folks might weep!

Inert Perfection 

"Inert Perfection, let me chip your shell. 
You cannot break it through with that soft beak. 
What if you broke it never, and it befell 
You should not issue thence, should never speak?" 

Perfection in the egg, a fluid thing, 
Grows solid in due course, and there exists; 
Knowing no urge to struggle forth and sing; 
Complete, though shell-bound. But the mind insists 

It shall be hatched ... to this ulterior end: 
That it be bound by Function, that it be 
Less than Perfection, having to expend 
Some force on a nostalgia to be free. 




Inland 

People that build their houses inland, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
People that buy a plot of ground 
Shaped like a house, and build a house there, 
Far from the sea-board, far from the sound 

Of water sucking the hollow ledges, 
Tons of water striking the shore, 
What do they long for, as I long for 
One salt smell of the sea once more? 

People the waves have not awakened, 
Spanking the boats at the harbour's head, 
What do they long for, as I long for, 
Starting up in my inland bed, 

Beating the narrow walls, and finding 
Neither a window nor a door, 
Screaming to God for death by drowning, 
One salt taste of the sea once more? 




Intention To Escape From Him 

I think I will learn some beautiful language, useless for commercial 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Purposes, work hard at that. 
I think I will learn the Latin name of every songbird, not only in 
America but wherever they sing. 
(Shun meditation, though; invite the controversial: 
Is the world flat? Do bats eat cats?) By digging hard I might 
deflect that river, my mind, that uncontrollable thing, 
Turgid and yellow, srong to overflow its banks in spring, 
carrying away bridges 
A bed of pebbles now, through which there trickles one clear 
narrow stream, following a course henceforth nefast 

Dig, dig; and if I come to ledges, blast. 




Interim 

The room is full of you!As I came in 
And closed the door behind me, all at once 
A something in the air, intangible, 
Yet stiff with meaning, struck my senses sick! 

Sharp, unfamiliar odors have destroyed 
Each other room's dear personality. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The heavy scent of damp, funereal flowers, 
The very essence, hush-distilled, of Death 
Has strangled that habitual breath of home 
Whose expiration leaves all houses dead; 
And wheresoe'er I look is hideous change. 
Save here. Here 'twas as if a weed-choked gate 
Had opened at my touch, and I had stepped 
Into some long-forgot, enchanted, strange, 
Sweet garden of a thousand years ago 
And suddenly thought, "I have been here before!" 

You are not here. I know that you are gone, 
And will not ever enter here again. 
And yet it seems to me, if I should speak, 
Your silent step must wake across the hall; 
If I should turn my head, that your sweet eyes 
Would kiss me from the door.So short a time 
To teach my life its transposition to 
This difficult and unaccustomed key! 
The room is as you left it; your last touch 
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself 
As saintlyhallows now each simple thing; 
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between 
The dust's grey fingers like a shielded light. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
There is your book, just as you laid it down, 
Face to the table,I cannot believe 
That you are gone!Just then it seemed to me 
You must be here. I almost laughed to think 
How like reality the dream had been; 
Yet knew before I laughed, and so was still. 
That book, outspread, just as you laid it down! 



Perhaps you thought, "I wonder what comes next, 
And whether this or this will be the end"; 
So rose, and left it, thinking to return. 

Perhaps that chair, when you arose and passed 
Out of the room, rocked silently a while 
Ere it again was still. When you were gone 
Forever from the room, perhaps that chair, 
Stirred by your movement, rocked a little while, 
Silently, to and fro... 

And here are the last words your fingers wrote, 

Scrawled in broad characters across a page 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In this brown book I gave you. Here your hand, 

Guiding your rapid pen, moved up and down. 

Here with a looping knot you crossed a "t," 

And here another like it, just beyond 

These two eccentric "e's." You were so small, 

And wrote so brave a hand! 
How strange it seems 

That of all words these are the words you chose! 

And yet a simple choice; you did not know 

You would not write again. If you had known 

But then, it does not matter,and indeed 

If you had known there was so little time 

You would have dropped your pen and come to me 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And this page would be empty, and some phrase 

Other than this would hold my wonder now. 

Yet, since you could not know, and it befell 

That these are the last words your fingers wrote, 

There is a dignity some might not see 

In this, "I picked the first sweet-pea to-day." 

To-day! Was there an opening bud beside it 

You left until to-morrow?O my love, 

The things that withered,and you came not back 

That day you filled this circle of my arms 

That now is empty. (O my empty life!) 

That daythat day you picked the first sweet-pea, 

And brought it in to show me! I recall 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

With terrible distinctness how the smell 

Of your cool gardens drifted in with you. 

I know, you held it up for me to see 



And flushed because I looked not at the flower, 
But at your face; and when behind my look 
You saw such unmistakable intent 
You laughed and brushed your flower against my lips. 
(You were the fairest thing God ever made, 
I think.) And then your hands above my heart 
Drew down its stem into a fastening, 
And while your head was bent I kissed your hair. 
I wonder if you knew. (Beloved hands! 
Somehow I cannot seem to see them still. 
Somehow I cannot seem to see the dust 
In your bright hair.) What is the need of Heaven 
When earth can be so sweet?If only God 
Had let us love,and show the world the way! 
Strange cancellings must ink th' eternal books 
When love-crossed-out will bring the answer right! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That first sweet-pea! I wonder where it is. 
It seems to me I laid it down somewhere, 
And yet,I am not sure. I am not sure, 
Even, if it was white or pink; for then 
'Twas much like any other flower to me 
Save that it was the first. I did not know 
Then, that it was the last. If I had known 
But then, it does not matter. Strange how few, 
After all's said and done, the things that are 
Of moment.

 Few indeed! When I can make 
Of ten small words a rope to hang the world! 
"I had you and I have you now no more." 
There, there it dangles,where's the little truth 
That can for long keep footing under that 
When its slack syllables tighten to a thought? 
Here, let me write it down! I wish to see 
Just how a thing like that will look on paper! 

"I had you and I have you now no more." 

O little words, how can you run so straight 
Across the page, beneath the weight you bear? 
How can you fall apart, whom such a theme 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Has bound together, and hereafter aid 
In trivial expression, that have been 



So hideously dignified?Would God 
That tearing you apart would tear the thread 
I strung you on! Would GodO God, my mind 
Stretches asunder on this merciless rack 
Of imagery! O, let me sleep a while! 
Would I could sleep, and wake to find me back 
In that sweet summer afternoon with you. 
Summer? Tis summer still by the calendar! 
How easily could God, if He so willed, 
Set back the world a little turn or two! 
Correct its griefs, and bring its joys again! 

We were so wholly one I had not thought 
That we could die apart. I had not thought 
That I could move,and you be stiff and still! 
That I could speak,and you perforce be dumb! 
I think our heart-strings were, like warp and woof 
In some firm fabric, woven in and out; 
Your golden filaments in fair design 
Across my duller fibre. And to-day 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The shining strip is rent; the exquisite 
Fine pattern is destroyed; part of your heart 
Aches in my breast; part of my heart lies chilled 
In the damp earth with you. I have been tom 
In two, and suffer for the rest of me. 
What is my life to me? And what am I 
To life,a ship whose star has guttered out? 
A Fear that in the deep night starts awake 
Perpetually, to find its senses strained 
Against the taut strings of the quivering air, 
Awaiting the return of some dread chord? 

Dark, Dark, is all I find for metaphor; 
All else were contrast,save that contrast's wall 
Is down, and all opposed things flow together 
Into a vast monotony, where night 
And day, and frost and thaw, and death and life, 
Are synonyms. What nowwhat now to me 
Are all the jabbering birds and foolish flowers 
That clutter up the world? You were my song! 
Now, let discord scream! You were my flower! 
Now let the world grow weeds! For I shall not 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Plant things above your grave(the common balm 
Of the conventional woe for its own wound!) 
Amid sensations rendered negative 
By your elimination stands to-day, 
Certain, unmixed, the element of grief; 
I sorrow; and I shall not mock my truth 
With travesties of suffering, nor seek 
To effigy its incorporeal bulk 
In little wry-faced images of woe. 

I cannot call you back; and I desire 
No utterance of my immaterial voice. 
I cannot even turn my face this way 
Or that, and say, "My face is turned to you"; 
I know not where you are, I do not know 
If Heaven hold you or if earth transmute, 
Body and soul, you into earth again; 
But this I know:not for one second's space 
Shall I insult my sight with visionings 
Such as the credulous crowd so eager-eyed 
Beholds, self-conjured, in the empty air. 
Let the world wail! Let drip its easy tears! 
My sorrow shall be dumb! 

What do I say? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
God! God!God pity me! Am I gone mad 
That I should spit upon a rosary? 
Am I become so shrunken? Would to God 
I too might feel that frenzied faith whose touch 
Makes temporal the most enduring grief; 
Though it must walk a while, as is its wont, 
With wild lamenting! Would I too might weep 
Where weeps the world and hangs its piteous wreaths 
For its new dead! Not Truth, but Faith, it is 
That keeps the world alive. If all at once 
Faith were to slacken,that unconscious faith 
Which must, I know, yet be the corner-stone 
Of all believing,birds now flying fearless 
Across would drop in terror to the earth; 
Fishes would drown; and the all-governing reins 
Would tangle in the frantic hands of God 
And the worlds gallop headlong to destruction! 



O God, I see it now, and my sick brain 
Staggers and swoons! How often over me 
Flashes this breathlessness of sudden sight 
In which I see the universe unrolled 
Before me like a scroll and read thereon 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Chaos and Doom, where helpless planets whirl 
Dizzily round and round and round and round, 
Like tops across a table, gathering speed 
With every spin, to waver on the edge 
One instantlooking overand the next 
To shudder and lurch forward out of sight

 * * * * * * * 

Ah, I am worn outI am wearied out 
It is too muchI am but flesh and blood, 
And I must sleep. Though you were dead again, 
I am but flesh and blood and I must sleep. 




Invocation To The Muses 

Read by the poet at The Public Ceremonial of The Naional Institute 
of Arts and Letters at Carnegie Hall, New York, January 18th, 1941. 

Great Muse, that from this hall absent for long 
Hast never been, 
Great Muse of Song, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Colossal Muse of mighty Melody, 
Vocal Calliope, 
With thine august and contrapuntal brow 
And thy vast throat builded for Harmony, 
For the strict monumental pure design, 
And the melodic line: 
Be thou tonight with all beneath these raftersbe with me. 
If I address thee in archaic style 
Words obsolete, words obsolescent, 
It is that for a little while 
The heart must, oh indeed must from this angry and out-rageous present 
Itself withdraw 
Into some past in which most crooked Evil, 
Although quite certainly conceived and born, was not as yet the Law. 

Archaic, or obsolescent at the least, 
Be thy grave speaking and the careful words of thy clear song, 
For the time wrongs us, and the words most common to our speech today 
Salute and welcome to the feast 
Conspicuous Evil or against him all day long 
Cry out, telling of ugly deeds and most uncommon wrong. 

Be thou tonight with all beneath these raftersbe with me 
But oh, be more with those who are not free. 
Who, herded into prison camps all shame must suffer and all outrage see. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Where music is not played nor sung, 
Though the great voice be there, no sound from the dry throat across the 
thickened tongue 
Comes forth; nor has he heart for it. 
Beauty in all thingsno, we cannot hope for that; but some place set 
apart for it. 
Here it may dwell; 
And with your aid, Melpomene 



And all thy sister-muses (for ye are, I think, daughters of Memory) 
Within the tortured mind as well. 

Reaped are those fields with dragon's-teeth so lately sown; 
Many the heaped men dying there - so close, hip touches thigh; yet each man 
dies alone. 
Music, what overtone 
For the soft ultimate sigh or the unheeded groan 
Hast thouto make death decent, where men slip 
Down blood to death, no service of grieved heart or ritual lip 
Transferring what was recently a man and still is warm 
Transferring his obedient limbs into the shallow grave where not again a friend 
shall greet him, 
Nor hatred do him harm . . . 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Nor true love run to meet him? 

In the last hours of him who lies untended 
On a cold field at night, and sees the hard bright stars 
Above his upturned face, and says aloud "How strange . . . my life is 
ended." 
If in the past he loved great music much, and knew it well, 
Let not his lapsing mind be teased by well-beloved but ill- remembered bars 
 
Let the full symphony across the blood-soaked field 
By him be heard, most pure in every part, 
The lonely horror of whose painful death is thus repealed, 
Who dies with quiet tears upon his upturned face, making to glow with softness 
the hard stars. 

And bring to those who knew great poetry well 
Page after page that they have loved but have not learned by heart! 
We who in comfort to well-lighted shelves 
Can turn for all the poets ever wrote, 
Beseech you: Bear to those 
Who love high art no less than we ourselves, 
Those who lie wounded, those who in prison cast 
Strive to recall, to ease them, some great ode, and every stanza save the last. 

Recalloh, in the dark, restore them 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The unremembered lines; make bright the page before them! 
Page after page present to these, 
In prison concentrated, watched by barbs of bayonet and wire, 



Give ye to them their hearts' intense desire 
The words of Shelley, Virgil, Sophocles. 

And thou, O lovely and not sad, 
Euterpe, be thou in this hall tonight! 
Bid us remember all we ever had 
Of sweet and gay delight 
We who are free, 
But cannot quite be glad, 
Thinking of huge, abrupt disaster brought 
Upon so many of our kind 
Who treasure as do we the vivid look on the unfrightened face, 
The careless happy stride from place to place, 
And the unbounded regions of untrammelled thought 
Open as interstellar space 
To the exploring and excited mind. 

O Muses, O immortal Nine! 
Or do ye languish? Can ye die? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Must all go under? 
How shall we heal without your help a world 
By these wild horses torn asunder? 
How shall we build anew?  How start again? 
How cure, how even moderate this pain 
Without you, and you strong? 
And if ye sleep, then waken! 
And if ye sicken and do plan to die, 
Do not that now! 

Hear us, in what sharp need we cry! 
For we have help nowhere 
If not in you! 
Pity can much, and so a mighty mind, but cannot all things do! 
By you forsaken, 
We shall be scattered, we shall be overtaken! 
Oh, come! Renew in us the ancient wonder, 
The grace of life, its courage, and its joy! 
Weave us those garlands nothing can destroy! 
Come! with your radiant eyes!  with your throats of thunder! 




Journey 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Ah, could I lay me down in this long grass 
And close my eyes, and let the quiet wind 
Blow over meI am so tired, so tired 
Of passing pleasant places! All my life, 
Following Care along the dusty road, 
Have I looked back at loveliness and sighed; 
Yet at my hand an unrelenting hand 
Tugged ever, and I passed. All my life long 
Over my shoulder have I looked at peace; 
And now I fain would lie in this long grass 
And close my eyes.

 Yet onward!

 Cat birds call 
Through the long afternoon, and creeks at dusk 
Are guttural. Whip-poor-wills wake and cry, 
Drawing the twilight close about their throats. 
Only my heart makes answer. Eager vines 
Go up the rocks and wait; flushed apple-trees 
Pause in their dance and break the ring for me; 
And bayberry, that through sweet bevies thread 
Of round-faced roses, pink and petulant, 
Look back and beckon ere they disappear. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Only my heart, only my heart responds. 
Yet, ah, my path is sweet on either side 
All through the dragging day,sharp underfoot 
And hot, and like dead mist the dry dust hangs 
But far, oh, far as passionate eye can reach, 
And long, ah, long as rapturous eye can cling, 
The world is mine: blue hill, still silver lake, 
Broad field, bright flower, and the long white road 
A gateless garden, and an open path: 
My feet to follow, and my heart to hold. 




Justice Denied In Massachusetts 

Let us abandon then our gardens and go home 
And sit in the sitting-room 
Shall the larkspur blossom or the corn grow under this cloud? 
Sour to the fruitful seed 
Is the cold earth under this cloud, 
Fostering quack and weed, we have marched upon but cannot 
conquer; 
We have bent the blades of our hoes against the stalks of them. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Let us go home, and sit in the sitting room. 
Not in our day 
Shall the cloud go over and the sun rise as before, 
Beneficent upon us 
Out of the glittering bay, 
And the warm winds be blown inward from the sea 
Moving the blades of corn 
With a peaceful sound. 

Forlorn, forlorn, 
Stands the blue hay-rack by the empty mow. 
And the petals drop to the ground, 
Leaving the tree unfruited. 
The sun that warmed our stooping backs and withered the weed 
uprooted 
We shall not feel it again. 
We shall die in darkness, and be buried in the rain. 

What from the splendid dead 
We have inherited  
Furrows sweet to the grain, and the weed subdued  
See now the slug and the mildew plunder. 
Evil does overwhelm 
The larkspur and the corn; 
We have seen them go under. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Let us sit here, sit still, 
Here in the sitting-room until we die; 
At the step of Death on the walk, rise and go; 
Leaving to our children's children the beautiful doorway, 



And this elm, 
And a blighted earth to till 
With a broken hoe. 




Kin To Sorrow 

Am I kin to Sorrow, 
That so oft 
Falls the knocker of my door

 Neither loud nor soft, 
But as long accustomed, 
Under Sorrow's hand? 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Marigolds around the step 
And rosemary stand, 
And then comes Sorrow 
And what does Sorrow care 
For the rosemary 
Or the marigolds there? 
Am I kin to Sorrow? 
Are we kin? 
That so oft upon my door 
Oh, come in! 




Lament 

Listen, children: 
Your father is dead. 
From his old coats 
I'll make you little jackets; 
I'll make you little trousers 
From his old pants. 
There'll be in his pockets 
Things he used to put there, 
Keys and pennies 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Covered with tobacco; 
Dan shall have the pennies 
To save in his bank; 
Anne shall have the keys 
To make a pretty noise with. 
Life must go on, 
And the dead be forgotten; 
Life must go on, 
Though good men die; 
Anne, eat your breakfast; 
Dan, take your medicine; 
Life must go on; 
I forget just why. 




Lines For A Grave-Stone 

Man alive, that mournst thy lot, 
Desiring what thou hast not got, 
Money, beauty, love, what not; 

Deeming it blesseder to be 
A rotted man, than live to see 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
So rude a sky as covers thee; 

Deeming thyself of all unblest 
And wretched souls the wretchedest, 
Longing to die and be at rest; 

Know: that however grim the fate 
Which sent thee forth to meditate 
Upon my enviable state, 

Here lieth one who would resign 
Gladly his lot, to shoulder thine. 
Give me thy coat; get into mine. 




Lines Written In Recapitulation 

I could not bring this splendid world nor any trading beast 
In charge of it, to defer, no, not to give ear, not in the least 
Appearance, to my handsome prophecies, 
which here I ponder and put by. 

I am left simpler, less encumbered, by the consciousness 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
that I shall by no pebble in my dirty sling 
avail To slay one purple giant four feet high and distribute arms 
among his tall attendants, who spit at his name 
when spitting on the ground: 
They will be found one day Prone where they fell, or dead sitting 
and pock-marked wall 
Supporting the beautiful back straight as an oak 
before it is old. 

I have learned to fail. And I have had my say. 
Yet shall I sing until my voice crack 
(this being my leisure, this my holiday) 
That man was a special thing, and no commodity, 
a thing improper to be sold. 




Love Is Not All 

Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink 
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain; 
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink 
And rise and sink and rise and sink again; 
Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone; 
Yet many a man is making friends with death 
Even as I speak, for lack of love alone. 
It well may be that in a difficult hour, 
Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, 
Or nagged by want past resolution's power, 
I might be driven to sell your love for peace, 
Or trade the memory of this night for food. 
It well may be. I do not think I would. 




Low-Tide 

These wet rocks where the tide has been, 
Barnacled white and weeded brown 
And slimed beneath to a beautiful green, 
These wet rocks where the tide went down 
Will show again when the tide is high 
Faint and perilous, far from shore, 
No place to dream, but a place to die, 
The bottom of the sea once more. 
There was a child that wandered through 
A giant's empty house all day, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
House full of wonderful things and new, 
But no fit place for a child to play. 




Make Bright The Arrows 

Make bright the arrows 
Gather the shields: 
Conquest narrows 
The peaceful fields. 

Stock well the quiver 
With arrows bright: 
The bowman feared 
Need never fight. 

Make bright the arrows, 
O peaceful and wise! 
Gather the shields 
Against surprise. 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Mariposa 

Butterflies are white and blue 
In this field we wander through. 
Suffer me to take your hand. 
Death comes in a day or two. 

All the things we ever knew 
Will be ashes in that hour, 
Mark the transient butterfly, 
How he hangs upon the flower. 

Suffer me to take your hand. 
Suffer me to cherish you 
Till the dawn is in the sky. 
Whether I be false or true, 
Death comes in a day or two. 




Memorial To D.C. 

(Vassar College, 1918) 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

O, loveliest throat of all sweet throats, 
Where now no more the music is, 
With hands that wrote you little notes 
I write you little elegies! 




Menses 

(He speaks, but to himself, being aware how it is with her) 
Think not I have not heard. 
Well-fanged the double word 
And well-directed flew. 

I felt it. Down my side 
Innocent as oil I see the ugly venom slide: 
Poison enough to stiffen us both, and all our friends; 
But I am not pierced, so there the mischief ends. 

There is more to be said: I see it coiling; 
The impact will be pain. 
Yet coil; yet strike again. 
You cannot riddle the stout mail I wove 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Long since, of wit and love. 

As for my answer . . . stupid in the sun 
He lies, his fangs drawn: 
I will not war with you. 

You know how wild you are. You are willing to be turned 
To other matters; you would be grateful, even. 
You watch me shyly. I (for I have learned 
More things than one in our few years together) 
Chafe at the churlish wind, the unseasonable weather. 

"Unseasonable?" you cry, with harsher scorn 
Than the theme warrants; "Every year it is the same! 
'Unseasonable!' they whine, these stupid peasants!and never 
since they were born 
Have they known a spring less wintry! Lord, the shame, 
The crying shame of seeing a man no wiser than the beasts he 
feeds 
His skull as empty as a shell!" 

("Go to. You are unwell.") 

Such is my thought, but such are not my words. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


"What is the name," I ask, "of those big birds 
With yellow breast and low and heavy flight, 
That make such mournful whistling?"

 "Meadowlarks," 
You answer primly, not a little cheered. 
"Some people shoot them." Suddenly your eyes are wet 
And your chin trembles. On my breast you lean, 
And sob most pitifullly for all the lovely things that are not and 
have been. 

"How silly I am!and I know how silly I am!" 
You say; "You are very patient. You are very kind. 
I shall be better soon. Just Heaven consign and damn 
To tedious Hell this body with its muddy feet in my mind!" 




Midnight Oil 

Cut if you will, with Sleep's dull knife, 
Each day to half its length, my friend, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The years that Time take off my life, 
He'll take from off the other end! 




Mist In The Valley 

These hills, to hurt me more, 
That am hurt already enough, 
Having left the sea behind, 
Having turned suddenly and left the shore 
That I had loved beyond all words, even a song's words, to 
convey, 

And built me a house on upland acres, 
Sweet with the pinxter, bright and rough 
With the rusty blackbird long before the winter's done, 
But smelling never of bayberry hot in the sun, 
Nor ever loud with the pounding of the long white breakers, 

These hills, beneath the October moon, 
Sit in the valley white with mist 
Like islands in a quiet bay, 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Jut out from shore into the mist, 
Wooded with poplar dark as pine, 
Like points of land into a quiet bay. 

(Just in the way 
The harbour met the bay) 

Stricken too sore for tears, 
I stand, remembering the Islands and the sea's lost sound 
Life at its best no longer than the sand-peep's cry, 
And I two years, two years, 
Tilling an upland ground! 




Modern Declaration 

I, having loved ever since I was a child a few things, never having 
wavered 
In these affections; never through shyness in the houses of the 
rich or in the presence of clergymen having denied these 
loves; 
Never when worked upon by cynics like chiropractors having 
grunted or clicked a vertebra to the discredit of those loves; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Never when anxious to land a job having diminished them by a 
conniving smile; or when befuddled by drink 
Jeered at them through heartache or lazily fondled the fingers of 
their alert enemies; declare 

That I shall love you always. 
No matter what party is in power; 
No matter what temporarily expedient combination of allied 
interests wins the war; 
Shall love you always. 




My Most Distinguished Guest And Learned Friend 

My most Distinguished Guest and Learned Friend, 
The pallid hare that runs before the day 
Having brought your earnest counsels to an end 
Now have I somewhat of my own to say: 
That it is folly to be sunk in love, 
And madness plain to make the matter known, 
There are no mysteries you are verger of; 
Everyman's wisdoms these are, and my own. 
If I have flung my heart unto a hound 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I have done ill, it is a certain thing; 
Yet breathe I freer, walk I the more sound 
On my sick bones for this brave reasoning? 
Soon must I say, " 'Tis prowling Death I hear!" 
Yet come no better off, for my quick ear. 




Night Is My Sister, And How Deep In Love 

Night is my sister, and how deep in love, 
How drowned in love and weedily washed ashore, 
There to be fretted by the drag and shove 
At the tide's edge, I liethese things and more: 
Whose arm alone between me and the sand, 
Whose voice alone, whose pitiful breath brought near, 
Could thaw these nostrils and unlock this hand, 
She could advise you, should you care to hear. 
Small chance, however, in a storm so black, 
A man will leave his friendly fire and snug 
For a drowned woman's sake, and bring her back 
To drip and scatter shells upon the rug. 
No one but Night, with tears on her dark face, 
Watches beside me in this windy place. 
<|endoftext|>

No Rose That In A Garden Ever Grew 

No rose that in a garden ever grew, 
In Homer's or in Omar's or in mine, 
Though buried under centuries of fine 
Dead dust of roses, shut from sun and dew 
Forever, and forever lost from view, 
But must again in fragrance rich as wine 
The grey aisles of the air incarnadine 
When the old summers surge into a new. 
Thus when I swear, "I love with all my heart," 
'Tis with the heart of Lilith that I swear, 
'Tis with the love of Lesbia and Lucrece; 
And thus as well my love must lose some part 
Of what it is, had Helen been less fair, 
Or perished young, or stayed at home in Greece. 




Not Even My Pride Shall Suffer Much 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Not even my pride shall suffer much; 
Not even my pride at all, maybe, 
If this ill-timed, intemperate clutch 
Be loosed by you and not by me, 
Will suffer; I have been so true 
A vestal to that only pride 
Wet wood cannot extinguish, nor 
Sand, nor its embers scattered, for, 
See all these years, it has not died. 

And if indeed, as I dare think, 
You cannot push this patient flame, 
By any breath your lungs could store, 
Even for a moment to the floor 
To crawl there, even for a moment crawl, 
What can you mix for me to drink 
That shall deflect me? What you do 
Is either malice, crude defense 
Of ego, or indifference: 
I know these things as well as you; 
You do not dazzle me at all 

Some love, and some simplicity, 
Might well have been the death of me 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>




Not In A Silver Casket Cool With Pearls 

Not in a silver casket cool with pearls 
Or rich with red corundum or with blue, 
Locked, and the key withheld, as other girls 
Have given their loves, I give my love to you; 
Not in a lovers'-knot, not in a ring 
Worked in such fashion, and the legend plain 
Semper fidelis, where a secret spring 
Kennels a drop of mischief for the brain: 
Love in the open hand, no thing but that, 
Ungemmed, unhidden, wishing not to hurt, 
As one should bring you cowslips in a hat 
Swung from the hand, or apples in her skirt, 
I bring you, calling out as children do: 
"Look what I have!And these are all for you." 




Ode To Silence 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Aye, but she? 
Your other sister and my other soul 
Grave Silence, lovelier 
Than the three loveliest maidens, what of her? 
Clio, not you, 
Not you, Calliope, 
Nor all your wanton line, 
Not Beauty's perfect self shall comfort me 
For Silence once departed, 
For her the cool-tongued, her the tranquil-hearted, 
Whom evermore I follow wistfully, 
Wandering Heaven and Earth and Hell and the four seasons through; 
Thalia, not you, 
Not you, Melpomene, 
Not your incomparable feet, O thin Terpsichore, I seek in this great hall, 
But one more pale, more pensive, most beloved of you all. 
I seek her from afar, 
I come from temples where her altars are, 
From groves that bear her name, 
Noisy with stricken victims now and sacrificial flame, 
And cymbals struck on high and strident faces 
Obstreperous in her praise 
They neither love nor know, 
A goddess of gone days, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Departed long ago, 
Abandoning the invaded shrines and fanes 
Of her old sanctuary, 
A deity obscure and legendary, 
Of whom there now remains, 
For sages to decipher and priests to garble, 
Only and for a little while her letters wedged in marble, 
Which even now, behold, the friendly mumbling rain erases, 
And the inarticulate snow, 
Leaving at last of her least signs and traces 
None whatsoever, nor whither she is vanished from these places. 
"She will love well," I said, 
"If love be of that heart inhabiter, 
The flowers of the dead; 
The red anemone that with no sound 



Moves in the wind, and from another wound 
That sprang, the heavily-sweet blue hyacinth, 
That blossoms underground, 
And sallow poppies, will be dear to her. 
And will not Silence know 
In the black shade of what obsidian steep 
Stiffens the white narcissus numb with sleep? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
(Seed which Demeter's daughter bore from home, 
Uptorn by desperate fingers long ago, 
Reluctant even as she, 
Undone Persephone, 
And even as she set out again to grow 
In twilight, in perdition's lean and inauspicious loam). 
She will love well," I said, 
"The flowers of the dead; 
Where dark Persephone the winter round, 
Uncomforted for home, uncomforted, 
Lacking a sunny southern slope in northern Sicily, 
With sullen pupils focussed on a dream, 
Stares on the stagnant stream 
That moats the unequivocable battlements of Hell, 
There, there will she be found, 
She that is Beauty veiled from men and Music in a swound." 

"I long for Silence as they long for breath 
Whose helpless nostrils drink the bitter sea; 
What thing can be 
So stout, what so redoubtable, in Death 
What fury, what considerable rage, if only she, 
Upon whose icy breast, 
Unquestioned, uncaressed, 
One time I lay, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And whom always I lack, 
Even to this day, 
Being by no means from that frigid bosom weaned away, 
If only she therewith be given me back?" 
I sought her down that dolorous labyrinth, 
Wherein no shaft of sunlight ever fell, 
And in among the bloodless everywhere 
I sought her, but the air, 
Breathed many times and spent, 
Was fretful with a whispering discontent, 



And questioning me, importuning me to tell 
Some slightest tidings of the light of day they know no more, 
Plucking my sleeve, the eager shades were with me where I went. 
I paused at every grievous door, 
And harked a moment, holding up my hand,and for a space 
A hush was on them, while they watched my face; 
And then they fell a-whispering as before; 
So that I smiled at them and left them, seeing she was not there. 
I sought her, too, 
Among the upper gods, although I knew 
She was not like to be where feasting is, 
Nor near to Heaven's lord, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Being a thing abhorred 
And shunned of him, although a child of his, 
(Not yours, not yours; to you she owes not breath, 
Mother of Song, being sown of Zeus upon a dream of Death). 
Fearing to pass unvisited some place 
And later learn, too late, how all the while, 
With her still face, 
She had been standing there and seen me pass, without a smile, 
I sought her even to the sagging board whereat 
The stout immortals sat; 
But such a laughter shook the mighty hall 
No one could hear me say: 
Had she been seen upon the Hill that day? 
And no one knew at all 
How long I stood, or when at last I sighed and went away. 

There is a garden lying in a lull 
Between the mountains and the mountainous sea, 
I know not where, but which a dream diurnal 
Paints on my lids a moment till the hull 
Be lifted from the kernel 
And Slumber fed to me. 
Your foot-print is not there, Mnemosene, 
Though it would seem a ruined place and after 
Your lichenous heart, being full 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of broken columns, caryatides 
Thrown to the earth and fallen forward on their jointless knees, 
And urns funereal altered into dust 
Minuter than the ashes of the dead, 
And Psyche's lamp out of the earth up-thrust, 



Dripping itself in marble wax on what was once the bed 
Of Love, and his young body asleep, but now is dust instead. 

There twists the bitter-sweet, the white wisteria Fastens its fingers in the 
strangling wall, 
And the wide crannies quicken with bright weeds; 
There dumbly like a worm all day the still white orchid feeds; 
But never an echo of your daughters' laughter 
Is there, nor any sign of you at all 
Swells fungous from the rotten bough, grey mother of Pieria! 

Only her shadow once upon a stone 
I saw,and, lo, the shadow and the garden, too, were gone. 

I tell you you have done her body an ill, 
You chatterers, you noisy crew! 
She is not anywhere! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I sought her in deep Hell; 
And through the world as well; 
I thought of Heaven and I sought her there; 
Above nor under ground 
Is Silence to be found, 
That was the very warp and woof of you, 
Lovely before your songs began and after they were through! 
Oh, say if on this hill 
Somewhere your sister's body lies in death, 
So I may follow there, and make a wreath 
Of my locked hands, that on her quiet breast 
Shall lie till age has withered them!

 (Ah, sweetly from the rest 

I see 

Turn and consider me 

Compassionate Euterpe!) 

"There is a gate beyond the gate of Death, 

Beyond the gate of everlasting Life, 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Beyond the gates of Heaven and Hell," she saith, 

"Whereon but to believe is horror! 

Whereon to meditate engendereth 

Even in deathless spirits such as I 

A tumult in the breath, 



A chilling of the inexhaustible blood 
Even in my veins that never will be dry, 
And in the austere, divine monotony 
That is my being, the madness of an unaccustomed mood. 

This is her province whom you lack and seek; 
And seek her not elsewhere. 
Hell is a thoroughfare 
For pilgrims,Herakles, 
And he that loved Euridice too well, 
Have walked therein; and many more than these; 
And witnessed the desire and the despair 
Of souls that passed reluctantly and sicken for the air; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
You, too, have entered Hell, 
And issued thence; but thence whereof I speak 
None has returned;for thither fury brings 
Only the driven ghosts of them that flee before all things. 
Oblivion is the name of this abode: and she is there." 

Oh, radiant Song! Oh, gracious Memory! 
Be long upon this height 
I shall not climb again! 
I know the way you mean,the little night, 
And the long empty day,never to see 
Again the angry light, 
Or hear the hungry noises cry my brain! 
Ah, but she, 
Your other sister and my other soul, 
She shall again be mine; 
And I shall drink her from a silver bowl, 
A chilly thin green wine, 
Not bitter to the taste, 
Not sweet, 
Not of your press, oh, restless, clamorous nine, 
To foam beneath the frantic hoofs of mirth 
But savoring faintly of the acid earth, 
And trod by pensive feet 
From perfect clusters ripened without haste 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Out of the urgent heat 
In some clear glimmering vaulted twilight under the odorous vine 

. Lift up your lyres! Sing on! 



But as for me, I seek your sister whither she is gone. 



Oh, My Belovèd, Have You Thought Of This 

Oh, my belovèd, have you thought of this: 
How in the years to come unscrupulous Time, 
More cruel than Death, will tear you from my kiss, 
And make you old, and leave me in my prime? 
How you and I, who scale together yet 
A little while the sweet, immortal height 
No pilgrim may remember or forget, 
As sure as the world turns, some granite night 
Shall lie awake and know the gracious flame 
Gone out forever on the mutual stone; 
And call to mind that on the day you came 
I was a child, and you a hero grown ? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the night pass, and the strange morning break 
Upon our anguish for each other's sake ! 




Oh, Oh, You Will Be Sorry 

Oh, oh, you will be sorry for that word! 
Give me back my book and take my kiss instead. 
Was it my enemy or my friend I heard, 
"What a big book for such a little head!" 
Come, I will show you now my newest hat, 
And you may watch me purse my mouth and prink! 
Oh, I shall love you still, and all of that. 
I never again shall tell you what I think. 
I shall be sweet and crafty, soft and sly; 
You will not catch me reading any more: 
I shall be called a wife to pattern by; 
And some day when you knock and push the door, 
Some sane day, not too bright and not too stormy, 
I shall be gone, and you may whistle for me.

Only Until This Cigarette Is Ended 

Only until this cigarette is ended, 
A little moment at the end of all, 
While on the floor the quiet ashes fall, 
And in the firelight to a lance extended, 
Bizarrely with the jazzing music blended, 
The broken shadow dances on the wall, 
I will permit my memory to recall 
The vision of you, by all my dreams attended. 
And then adieu,--farewell!--the dream is done. 
Yours is a face of which I can forget 
The colour and the features, every one, 
The words not ever, and the smiles not yet; 
But in your day this moment is the sun 
Upon a hill, after the sun has set. 




Passer Mortuus Est 

Death devours all lovely things; 
Lesbia with her sparrow 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Shares the darkness,presently 
Every bed is narrow. 

Unremembered as old rain 
Dries the sheer libation, 
And the little petulant hand 
Is an annotation. 

After all, my erstwhile dear, 
My no longer cherished, 
Need we say it was not love, 
Now that love is perished? 




Pastoral 

If it were only still! 
With far away the shrill 
Crying of a cock; 
Or the shaken bell 
From a cow's throat 
Moving through the bushes; 
Or the soft shock 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of wizened apples falling 
From an old tree 
In a forgotten orchard 
Upon the hilly rock! 

Oh, grey hill, 
Where the grazing herd 
Licks the purple blossom, 
Crops the spiky weed! 
Oh, stony pasture, 
Where the tall mullein 
Stands up so sturdy 
On its little seed! 




Pity Me Not Because The Light Of Day 

Pity me not because the light of day 
At close of day no longer walks the sky; 
Pity me not for beauties passed away 
From field and thicket as the the year goes by; 
Pity me not the waning of the moon, 
Nor that the ebbing tide goes out to sea, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Nor that a man's desire is hushed so soon, 
And you no longer look with love on me. 
This have I known always: Love is no more 
Than the wide blossom which the wind assails, 
Than the great tide that treads the shifting shore, 
Strewing fresh wreckage gathered in the gales: 
Pity me that the heart is slow to learn 
What the swift mind beholds at ever turn. 




Portrait By A Neighbour 

Before she has her floor swept 
Or her dishes done, 
Any day you'll find her 
A-sunning in the sun! 

It's long after midnight 
Her key's in the lock, 
And you never see her chimney smoke 
Til past ten o'clock! 

She digs in her garden 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
With a shovel and a spoon, 
She weeds her lazy lettuce 
By the light of the moon, 

She walks up the walk 
Like a woman in a dream, 
She forgets she borrowed butter 
Any pays you back in cream! 

Her lawn looks like a meadow, 
And if she mows the place 
She leaves the clover standing 
And the Queen Anne's lace! 




Prayer To Persephone 

Be to her, Persephone, 
All the things I might not be: 
Take her head upon your knee. 
She that was so proud and wild, 
Flippant, arrogant and free, 
She that had no need of me, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Is a little lonely child 
Lost in Hell,Persephone, 
Take her head upon your knee: 
Say to her, "My dear, my dear, 
It is not so dreadful here." 




Recuerdo

 We were very tired, we were very merry -We 
had gone back and forth all night upon the ferry. 
It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable -But 
we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table, 
We lay on the hill-top underneath the moon; 
And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon. 
We were very tired, we were very merry -We 
had gone back and forth all night on the ferry; 
And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,

 From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere; 
And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold, 
And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
We were very tired, we were very merry, 
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry. 
We hailed, "Good morrow, mother!" to a shawl-covered head, 
And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read; 
And she wept, "God bless you!" for the apples and the pears, 
And we gave her all our money but our subway fares. 




Renascence 

All I could see from where I stood 
Was three long mountains and a wood; 
I turned and looked another way, 
And saw three islands in a bay. 
So with my eyes I traced the line 
Of the horizon, thin and fine, 
Straight around till I was come 
Back to where I'd started from; 
And all I saw from where I stood 
Was three long mountains and a wood. 
Over these things I could not see; 
These were the things that bounded me; 
And I could touch them with my hand, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Almost, I thought, from where I stand. 
And all at once things seemed so small 
My breath came short, and scarce at all. 
But, sure, the sky is big, I said; 
Miles and miles above my head; 
So here upon my back I'll lie 
And look my fill into the sky. 
And so I looked, and, after all, 
The sky was not so very tall. 
The sky, I said, must somewhere stop, 
And -- sure enough! -- I see the top! 
The sky, I thought, is not so grand; 
I 'most could touch it with my hand! 
And, reaching up my hand to try, 
I screamed to feel it touch the sky. 

I screamed, and -- lo! -- Infinity 
Came down and settled over me; 
And, pressing of the Undefined 
The definition on my mind, 
Held up before my eyes a glass 
Through which my shrinking sight did pass 
Until it seemed I must behold 
Immensity made manifold; 
Whispered to me a word whose sound 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Deafened the air for worlds around, 



And brought unmuffled to my ears 
The gossiping of friendly spheres, 
The creaking of the tented sky, 
The ticking of Eternity. 
I saw and heard, and knew at last 
The How and Why of all things, past, 
And present, and forevermore. 
The universe, cleft to the core, 
Lay open to my probing sense 
That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence 
But could not, -- nay! But needs must suck 
At the great wound, and could not pluck 
My lips away till I had drawn 
All venom out. -- Ah, fearful pawn! 
For my omniscience paid I toll 
In infinite remorse of soul. 
All sin was of my sinning, all 
Atoning mine, and mine the gall 
Of all regret. Mine was the weight 
Of every brooded wrong, the hate 
That stood behind each envious thrust, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Mine every greed, mine every lust. 
And all the while for every grief, 
Each suffering, I craved relief 
With individual desire, -Craved 
all in vain! And felt fierce fire 
About a thousand people crawl; 
Perished with each, -- then mourned for all! 
A man was starving in Capri; 
He moved his eyes and looked at me; 
I felt his gaze, I heard his moan, 
And knew his hunger as my own. 
I saw at sea a great fog-bank 
Between two ships that struck and sank; 
A thousand screams the heavens smote; 
And every scream tore through my throat. 
No hurt I did not feel, no death 
That was not mine; mine each last breath 
That, crying, met an answering cry 
From the compassion that was I. 
All suffering mine, and mine its rod; 
Mine, pity like the pity of God. 



Ah, awful weight! Infinity 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Pressed down upon the finite Me! 
My anguished spirit, like a bird, 
Beating against my lips I heard; 
Yet lay the weight so close about 
There was no room for it without. 
And so beneath the Weight lay I 
And suffered death, but could not die. 

Long had I lain thus, craving death, 
When quietly the earth beneath 
Gave way, and inch by inch, so great 
At last had grown the crushing weight, 
Into the earth I sank till I 
Full six feet under ground did lie, 
And sank no more, -- there is no weight 
Can follow here, however great. 
From off my breast I felt it roll, 
And as it went my tortured soul 
Burst forth and fled in such a gust 
That all about me swirled the dust. 

Deep in the earth I rested now; 
Cool is its hand upon the brow 
And soft its breast beneath the head 
Of one who is so gladly dead. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And all at once, and over all, 
The pitying rain began to fall; 
I lay and heard each pattering hoof 
Upon my lowly, thatched roof, 
And seemed to love the sound far more 
Than ever I had done before. 
For rain it hath a friendly sound 
To one who's six feet underground; 
And scarce the friendly voice or face: 
A grave is such a quiet place. 

The rain, I said, is kind to come 
And speak to me in my new home. 
I would I were alive again 
To kiss the fingers of the rain, 
To drink into my eyes the shine 



Of every slanting silver line, 
To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze 
From drenched and dripping apple-trees. 
For soon the shower will be done, 
And then the broad face of the sun 
Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Until the world with answering mirth 
Shakes joyously, and each round drop 
Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top. 
How can I bear it; buried here, 
While overhead the sky grows clear 
And blue again after the storm? 
O, multi-colored, multiform, 
Beloved beauty over me, 
That I shall never, never see 
Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold, 
That I shall never more behold! 
Sleeping your myriad magics through, 
Close-sepulchred away from you! 
O God, I cried, give me new birth, 
And put me back upon the earth! 
Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd 
And let the heavy rain, down-poured 
In one big torrent, set me free, 
Washing my grave away from me! 

I ceased; and, through the breathless hush 
That answered me, the far-off rush 
Of herald wings came whispering 
Like music down the vibrant string 
Of my ascending prayer, and -- crash! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Before the wild wind's whistling lash 
The startled storm-clouds reared on high 
And plunged in terror down the sky, 
And the big rain in one black wave 
Fell from the sky and struck my grave. 

I know not how such things can be 
I only know there came to me 
A fragrance such as never clings 
To aught save happy living things; 
A sound as of some joyous elf 



Singing sweet songs to please himself, 
And, through and over everything, 
A sense of glad awakening. 
The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear, 
Whispering to me I could hear; 
I felt the rain's cool finger-tips 
Brushed tenderly across my lips, 
Laid gently on my sealed sight, 
And all at once the heavy night 
Fell from my eyes and I could see, -A 
drenched and dripping apple-tree, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
A last long line of silver rain, 
A sky grown clear and blue again. 
And as I looked a quickening gust 
Of wind blew up to me and thrust 
Into my face a miracle 
Of orchard-breath, and with the smell, -I 
know not how such things can be! -I 
breathed my soul back into me. 
Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I 
And hailed the earth with such a cry 
As is not heard save from a man 
Who has been dead, and lives again. 
About the trees my arms I wound; 
Like one gone mad I hugged the ground; 
I raised my quivering arms on high; 
I laughed and laughed into the sky, 
Till at my throat a strangling sob 
Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb 
Sent instant tears into my eyes; 
O God, I cried, no dark disguise 
Can e'er hereafter hide from me 
Thy radiant identity! 
Thou canst not move across the grass 
But my quick eyes will see Thee pass, 
Nor speak, however silently, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But my hushed voice will answer Thee. 
I know the path that tells Thy way 
Through the cool eve of every day; 
God, I can push the grass apart 
And lay my finger on Thy heart! 



The world stands out on either side 
No wider than the heart is wide; 
Above the world is stretched the sky, -No 
higher than the soul is high. 
The heart can push the sea and land 
Farther away on either hand; 
The soul can split the sky in two, 
And let the face of God shine through. 
But East and West will pinch the heart 
That cannot keep them pushed apart; 
And he whose soul is flat -- the sky 
Will cave in on him by and by. 




Rosemary 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

For the sake of some things 
That be now no more 
I will strew rushes 
On my chamber-floor, 
I will plant bergamot 
At my kitchen-door. 

For the sake of dim things 
That were once so plain 
I will set a barrel 
Out to catch the rain, 
I will hang an iron pot 
On an iron crane. 

Many things be dead and gone 
That were brave and gay; 
For the sake of these things 
I will learn to say, 
"An it please you, gentle sirs," 
"Alack!" and "Well-a-day!"

Scrub 

If I grow bitterly, 
Like a gnarled and stunted tree, 
Bearing harshly of my youth 
Puckered fruit that sears the mouth; 
If I make of my drawn boughs 
An Inshospitable House, 
Out of which I nevery pry 
Towards the water and the sky, 
Under which I stand and hide 
And hear the day go by outside; 
It is that a wind to strong 
Bent my back when I was young, 
It is that I fear the rain 
Lest it blister me again.

She Is Overheard Singing 

Oh, Prue she has a patient man, 
And Joan a gentle lover, 
And Agatha's Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,­— 
But my true love's a rover! 

Mig, her man's as good as cheese 
And honest as a briar, 
Sue tells her love what he's thinking of,­— 
But my dear lad's a liar! 

Oh, Sue and Prue and Agatha 
Are thick with Mig and Joan! 
They bite their threads and shake their heads 
And gnaw my name like a bone; 

And Prue says, "Mine's a patient man, 
As never snaps me up,' 
And Agatha, "Arth' is a hug-the-hearth, 
Could live content in a cup,' 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Sue's man's mind is like good jell­— 
All one color, and clear­— 
And Mig's no call to think at all 
What's to come next year, 

While Joan makes boast of a gentle lad, 
That's troubled with that and this;­— 
But they all would give the life they live 
For a look from the man I kiss! 

Cold he slants his eyes about, 
And few enough's his choice,­— 
Though he'd slip me clean for a nun, or a queen, 
Or a beggar with knots in her voice,­ — 

And Agatha will turn awake 
While her good man sleeps sound, 
And Mig and Sue and Joan and Prue 
Will hear the clock strike round, 



For Prue she has a patient man, 
As asks not when or why, 
And Mig and Sue have naught to do 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But peep who's passing by, 

Joan is paired with a putterer 
That bastes and tastes and salts, 
And Agatha's Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,­— 
But my true love is false! 




Song Of A Second April 

April this year, not otherwise 
Than April of a year ago, 
Is full of whispers, full of sighs, 
Of dazzling mud and dingy snow; 
Hepaticas that pleased you so 
Are here again, and butterflies. 

There rings a hammering all day, 
And shingles lie about the doors; 
In orchards near and far away 
The grey wood-pecker taps and bores; 
The men are merry at their chores, 
And children earnest at their play. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

The larger streams run still and deep, 
Noisy and swift the small brooks run 
Among the mullein stalks the sheep 
Go up the hillside in the sun, 
Pensively,only you are gone, 
You that alone I cared to keep. 




Sonnet (Women Have Loved Before As I Love Now) 

Women have loved before as I love now; 
At least, in lively chronicles of the past 
Of Irish waters by a Cornish prow 
Or Trojan waters by a Spartan mast 
Much to their cost invadedhere and there, 
Hunting the amorous line, skimming the rest, 
I find some woman bearing as I bear 
Love like a burning city in the breast. 
I think however that of all alive 
I only in such utter, ancient way 
Do suffer love; in me alone survive 
The unregenerate passions of a day 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
When treacherous queens, with death upon the tread, 
Heedless and willful, took their knights to bed. 




Sonnet 01: Thou Art Not Lovelier Than 
Lilacs,&Mdash;No 

Thou art not lovelier than lilacs,no, 
Nor honeysuckle; thou art not more fair 
Than small white single poppies,I can bear 

Thy beauty; though I bend before thee, though 

From left to right, not knowing where to go, 
I turn my troubled eyes, nor here nor there 
Find any refuge from thee, yet I swear 

So has it been with mist,with moonlight so. 

Like him who day by day unto his draught

 Of delicate poison adds him one drop more 
Till he may drink unharmed the death of ten, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Even so, inured to beauty, who have quaffed

 Each hour more deeply than the hour before, 
I drinkand livewhat has destroyed some men. 




Sonnet 02: Time Does Not Bring Relief; You All Have 
Lied 

Time does not bring relief; you all have lied 
Who told me time would ease me of my pain! 
I miss him in the weeping of the rain; 

I want him at the shrinking of the tide; 

The old snows melt from every mountain-side, 
And last year's leaves are smoke in every lane; 
But last year's bitter loving must remain 

Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide 

There are a hundred places where I fear

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 To go,so with his memory they brim 
And entering with relief some quiet place 
Where never fell his foot or shone his face 
I say, "There is no memory of him here!"

 And so stand stricken, so remembering him! 




Sonnet 03: Mindful Of You The Sodden Earth In 
Spring 

Mindful of you the sodden earth in spring, 
And all the flowers that in the springtime grow, 
And dusty roads, and thistles, and the slow 

Rising of the round moon, all throats that sing 

The summer through, and each departing wing, 
And all the nests that the bared branches show, 
And all winds that in any weather blow, 

And all the storms that the four seasons bring. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
You go no more on your exultant feet 
Up paths that only mist and morning knew, 
Or watch the wind, or listen to the beat 
Of a bird's wings too high in air to view, 
But you were something more than young and sweet 
And fair,and the long year remembers you. 




Sonnet 04: Not In This Chamber Only At My Birth 

Not in this chamber only at my birth 
When the long hours of that mysterious night 
Were over, and the morning was in sight 

I cried, but in strange places, steppe and firth 

I have not seen, through alien grief and mirth; 
And never shall one room contain me quite 
Who in so many rooms first saw the light, 

Child of all mothers, native of the earth. 

So is no warmth for me at any fire 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To-day, when the world's fire has burned so low; 

I kneel, spending my breath in vain desire, 

At that cold hearth which one time roared so strong, 

And straighten back in weariness, and long 
To gather up my little gods and go. 




Sonnet 05: If I Should Learn, In Some Quite Casual 
Way 

If I should learn, in some quite casual way, 
That you were gone, not to return again 
Read from the back-page of a paper, say, 
Held by a neighbor in a subway train, 
How at the corner of this avenue 
And such a street (so are the papers filled) 
A hurrying manwho happened to be you 
At noon to-day had happened to be killed, 
I should not cry aloudI could not cry 
Aloud, or wring my hands in such a place 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

I should but watch the station lights rush by 
With a more careful interest on my face, 
Or raise my eyes and read with greater care

 Where to store furs and how to treat the hair. 




Sonnet 06: Bluebeard 

This door you might not open, and you did; 
So enter now, and see for what slight thing 
You are betrayed.... Here is no treasure hid 
No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring 
The sought-for truth, no heads of women slain 
For greed like yours, no writhings of distress 
But only what you see.... Look yet again 
An empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless 
Yet this alone out of my life I kept 
Unto myself, lest any know me quite; 
And you did so profane me when you crept

 Unto the threshold of this room to-night 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That I must never more behold your face. 
This now is yours. I seek another place. 




Sonnet I: Thou Art Not Lovelier Than Lilacs 

Thou art not lovelier than lilacs,--no, 
Nor honeysuckle; thou art not more fair 
Than small white single poppies,--I can bear 

Thy beauty; though I bend before thee, though 

From left to right, not knowing where to go, 
I turn my troubled eyes, nor here nor there 
Find any refuge from thee, yet I swear 

So has it been with mist,--with moonlight so. 
Like him who day by day unto his draught

 Of delicate poison adds him one drop more 
Till he may drink unharmed the death of ten, 
Even so, inured to beauty, who have quaffed

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 Each hour more deeply than the hour before, 
I drink--and live--what has destroyed some men. 




Sonnet Iii: Mindful Of You The Sodden Earth 

Mindful of you the sodden earth in spring, 
And all the flowers that in the springtime grow, 
And dusty roads, and thistles, and the slow 

Rising of the round moon, all throats that sing 

The summer through, and each departing wing, 
And all the nests that the bared branches show, 
And all winds that in any weather blow, 

And all the storms that the four seasons bring. 
You go no more on your exultant feet 
Up paths that only mist and morning knew, 
Or watch the wind, or listen to the beat 
Of a bird's wings too high in air to view,-But 
you were something more than young and sweet 
And fair,--and the long year remembers you. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>




Sonnet V: If I Should Learn 

If I should learn, in some quite casual way, 
That you were gone, not to return again-Read 
from the back-page of a paper, say, 
Held by a neighbor in a subway train, 
How at the corner of this avenue

 And such a street (so are the papers filled) 
A hurrying man--who happened to be you-At 
noon to-day had happened to be killed, 

I should not cry aloud--I could not cry 
Aloud, or wring my hands in such a place-I 
should but watch the station lights rush by

 With a more careful interest on my face, 
Or raise my eyes and read with greater care 
Where to store furs and how to treat the hair. 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


Sonnet Vi: This Door You Might Not Open 

This door you might not open, and you did; 
So enter now, and see for what slight thing 
You are betrayed.... Here is no treasure hid,

 No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring 
The sought-for truth, no heads of women slain 
For greed like yours, no writhings of distress, 
But only what you see.... Look yet again-An 
empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless. 
Yet this alone out of my life I kept 
Unto myself, lest any know me quite; 
And you did so profane me when you crept

 Unto the threshold of this room to-night 
That I must never more behold your face. 
This now is yours. I seek another place.

<|startoftext|>

VIII8. 
Oh, oh, you will be sorry for that word! 
. 
Give back my book and take my kiss instead. 
. 
Was it my enemy or my friend I heard, 
. 
"What a big book for such a little head!" 
. 
Come, I will show you now my newest hat, 
. 
And you may watch me purse my mouth and prink! 
. 
Oh, I shall love you still, and all of that. 
. 
I never again shall tell you what I think. 
. 
I shall be sweet and crafty, soft and sly; 
.

 You will not catch me reading any more: 
.

 I shall be called a wife to pattern by; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
.

 And some day when you knock and push the door, 
.

 Some sane day, not too bright and not too stormy, 
.

 I shall be gone, and you may whistle for me. IX9. 
Here is a wound that never will heal, I know, 
. 
Being wrought not of a dearness and a death, 
. 
But of a love turned ashes and the breath 
. 



 Gone out of beauty; never again will grow 
. 
The grass on that scarred acre, though I sow 
. 
Young seed there yearly and the sky bequeath 
. 
Its friendly weathers down, far underneath 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
. 
Shall be such bitterness of an old woe. 
. 
That April should be shattered by a gust, 
.

 That August should be levelled by a rain, 
.

 I can endure, and that the lifted dust 
.

 Of man should settle to the earth again; 
.

 But that a dream can die, will be a thrust 
.

 Between my ribs forever of hot pain. XVIII18. 
I, being born a woman and distressed 
. 
By all the needs and notions of my kind, 
. 
Am urged by your propinquity to find 
. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Your person fair, and feel a certain zest 
. 
To bear your body's weight upon my breast: 
. 
So subtly is the fume of life designed, 
. 
To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind, 
. 
And leave me once again undone, possessed. 
. 



 Think not for this, however, the poor treason 
.

 Of my stout blood against my staggering brain, 
.

 I shall remember you with love, or season 
.

 My scorn with pity, -- let me make it plain: 
.

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 I find this frenzy insufficient reason 
.

 For conversation when we meet again. XIX19. 
What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, 
. 
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain 
. 
Under my head till morning; but the rain 
. 
Is full of ghosts to-night, that tap and sigh 
. 
Upon the glass and listen for reply, 
. 
And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain 
. 
For unremembered lads that not again 
. 
Will turn to me at midnight with a cry. 
. 
Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree, 
.

 Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one, 
.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 Yet knows its boughs more silent than before: 
.

 I cannot say what loves have come and gone, 



.

 I only know that summer sang in me 
.

 A little while, that in me sings no more. 



Sonnets 01: We Talk Of Taxes, And I Call You Friend 

We talk of taxes, and I call you friend; 
Well, such you are,but well enough we know 
How thick about us root, how rankly grow 
Those subtle weeds no man has need to tend, 
That flourish through neglect, and soon must send 
Perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Our steady senses; how such matters go 
We are aware, and how such matters end. 
Yet shall be told no meagre passion here; 
With lovers such as we forevermore 
Isolde drinks the draught, and Guinevere 
Receives the Table's ruin through her door, 
Francesca, with the loud surf at her ear, 
Lets fall the colored book upon the floor. 




Sonnets 02: Into The Golden Vessel Of Great Song 

Into the golden vessel of great song 
Let us pour all our passion; breast to breast 
Let other lovers lie, in love and rest; 
Not we,articulate, so, but with the tongue 
Of all the world: the churning blood, the long 
Shuddering quiet, the desperate hot palms pressed 
Sharply together upon the escaping guest, 
The common soul, unguarded, and grown strong. 
Longing alone is singer to the lute; 
Let still on nettles in the open sigh 
The minstrel, that in slumber is as mute 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
As any man, and love be far and high, 
That else forsakes the topmost branch, a fruit 
Found on the ground by every passer-by. 




Sonnets 03: Not With Libations, But With Shouts And 
Laughter 

Not with libations, but with shouts and laughter 
We drenched the altars of Love's sacred grove, 
Shaking to earth green fruits, impatient after 
The launching of the colored moths of Love. 
Love's proper myrtle and his mother's zone 
We bound about our irreligious brows, 
And fettered him with garlands of our own, 
And spread a banquet in his frugal house. 
Not yet the god has spoken; but I fear 
Though we should break our bodies in his flame, 
And pour our blood upon his altar, here 
Henceforward is a grove without a name, 
A pasture to the shaggy goats of Pan, 
Whence flee forever a woman and a man. 

<|endoftext|>

Sonnets 04: Only Until This Cigarette Is Ended 

Only until this cigarette is ended, 
A little moment at the end of all, 
While on the floor the quiet ashes fall, 
And in the firelight to a lance extended, 
Bizarrely with the jazzing music blended, 
The broken shadow dances on the wall, 
I will permit my memory to recall 
The vision of you, by all my dreams attended. 
And then adieu,farewell!the dream is done. 
Yours is a face of which I can forget 
The color and the features, every one, 
The words not ever, and the smiles not yet; 
But in your day this moment is the sun 
Upon a hill, after the sun has set. 




Sonnets 05: Once More Into My Arid Days Like Dew 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Once more into my arid days like dew, 
Like wind from an oasis, or the sound 
Of cold sweet water bubbling underground, 
A treacherous messenger, the thought of you 
Comes to destroy me; once more I renew 
Firm faith in your abundance, whom I found 
Long since to be but just one other mound 
Of sand, whereon no green thing ever grew. 
And once again, and wiser in no wise, 
I chase your colored phantom on the air, 
And sob and curse and fall and weep and rise 
And stumble pitifully on to where, 
Miserable and lost, with stinging eyes, 
Once more I clasp,and there is nothing there. 




Sonnets 06: No Rose That In A Garden Ever Grew 

No rose that in a garden ever grew, 
In Homer's or in Omar's or in mine, 
Though buried under centuries of fine 
Dead dust of roses, shut from sun and dew 
Forever, and forever lost from view, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But must again in fragrance rich as wine 
The grey aisles of the air incarnadine 
When the old summers surge into a new. 
Thus when I swear, "I love with all my heart," 
'Tis with the heart of Lilith that I swear, 
'Tis with the love of Lesbia and Lucrece; 
And thus as well my love must lose some part 
Of what it is, had Helen been less fair, 
Or perished young, or stayed at home in Greece. 




Sonnets 07: When I Too Long Have Looked Upon Your 
Face 

When I too long have looked upon your face, 
Wherein for me a brightness unobscured 
Save by the mists of brightness has its place, 
And terrible beauty not to be endured, 
I turn away reluctant from your light, 
And stand irresolute, a mind undone, 
A silly, dazzled thing deprived of sight 
From having looked too long upon the sun. 
Then is my daily life a narrow room 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In which a little while, uncertainly, 
Surrounded by impenetrable gloom, 
Among familiar things grown strange to me 
Making my way, I pause, and feel, and hark, 
Till I become accustomed to the dark. 




Sonnets 08: And You As Well Must Die, Beloved Dust 

And you as well must die, beloved dust, 
And all your beauty stand you in no stead; 
This flawless, vital hand, this perfect head, 
This body of flame and steel, before the gust 
Of Death, or under his autumnal frost, 
Shall be as any leaf, be no less dead 
Than the first leaf that fell,--this wonder fled. 
Altered, estranged, disintegrated, lost. 
Nor shall my love avail you in your hour. 
In spite of all my love, you will arise 
Upon that day and wander down the air 
Obscurely as the unattended flower, 
It mattering not how beautiful you were, 
Or how beloved above all else that dies. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>




Sonnets 09: Let You Not Say Of Me When I Am Old 

Let you not say of me when I am old, 
In pretty worship of my withered hands 
Forgetting who I am, and how the sands 
Of such a life as mine run red and gold 
Even to the ultimate sifting dust, "Behold, 
Here walketh passionless age!"for there expands 
A curious superstition in these lands, 
And by its leave some weightless tales are told. 

In me no lenten wicks watch out the night; 
I am the booth where Folly holds her fair; 
Impious no less in ruin than in strength, 
When I lie crumbled to the earth at length, 
Let you not say, "Upon this reverend site 
The righteous groaned and beat their breasts in prayer." 




<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Sonnets 10: Oh, My Beloved, Have You Thought Of 
This 

Oh, my beloved, have you thought of this: 
How in the years to come unscrupulous Time, 
More cruel than Death, will tear you from my kiss, 
And make you old, and leave me in my prime? 
How you and I, who scale together yet 
A little while the sweet, immortal height 
No pilgrim may remember or forget, 
As sure as the world turns, some granite night 
Shall lie awake and know the gracious flame 
Gone out forever on the mutual stone; 
And call to mind that on the day you came 
I was a child, and you a hero grown? 
And the night pass, and the strange morning break 
Upon our anguish for each other's sake! 




Sonnets 11: As To Some Lovely Temple, Tenantless 

As to some lovely temple, tenantless 
Long since, that once was sweet with shivering brass, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Knowing well its altars ruined and the grass 
Grown up between the stones, yet from excess 
Of grief hard driven, or great loneliness, 
The worshiper returns, and those who pass 
Marvel him crying on a name that was, 
So is it now with me in my distress. 
Your body was a temple to Delight; 
Cold are its ashes whence the breath is fled, 
Yet here one time your spirit was wont to move; 
Here might I hope to find you day or night, 
And here I come to look for you, my love, 
Even now, foolishly, knowing you are dead. 




Sonnets 12: Cherish You Then The Hope I Shall 
Forget 

Cherish you then the hope I shall forget 
At length, my lord, Pieria?put away 
For your so passing sake, this mouth of clay 
These mortal bones against my body set, 
For all the puny fever and frail sweat 
Of human love,renounce for these, I say, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The Singing Mountain's memory, and betray 
The silent lyre that hangs upon me yet? 
Ah, but indeed, some day shall you awake, 
Rather, from dreams of me, that at your side 
So many nights, a lover and a bride, 
But stern in my soul's chastity, have lain, 
To walk the world forever for my sake, 
And in each chamber find me gone again! 




Sonnets From An Ungrafted Tree 

XLI 

I, being born a woman and distressed 
By all the needs and notions of my kind, 
Am urged by your propinquity to find 
Your person fair, and feel a certain zest 
To bear you body's weight upon my breast: 
So subtly is the fume of life designed, 
To clairfy the pulse and cloud the mind, 
And leave me once again undone, possessed. 
Think not for this, however, the poor treason 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of my stout blood against my staggering brain, 
I shall remember you with love, or season 
My scorn with pity,let me make it plain: 
I find ths frenzy insufficient reason 
For conversation when we meet again. 




Sorrow 

Sorrow like a ceaseless rain

 Beats upon my heart. 
People twist and scream in pain, 
Dawn will find them still again; 
This has neither wax nor wane,

 Neither stop nor start. 

People dress and go to town;

 I sit in my chair. 
All my thoughts are slow and brown: 
Standing up or sitting down 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Little matters, or what gown

 Or what shoes I wear. 




Souvenir 

Just a rainy day or two 
In a windy tower, 
That was all I had of you 
Saving half an hour. 

Marred by greeting passing groups 
In a cinder walk, 
Near some naked blackberry hoops 
Dim with purple chalk. 
I remember three or four 
Things you said in spite, 
And an ugly coat you wore, 
Plaided black and white. 

Just a rainy day or two 
And a bitter word. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Why do I remember you 
As a singing bird? 




Spring 

To what purpose, April, do you return again? 
Beauty is not enough. 
You can no longer quiet me with the redness 
Of little leaves opening stickily. 
I know what I know. 
The sun is hot on my neck as I observe 
The spikes of the crocus. 
The smell of the earth is good. 
It is apparent that there is no death. 
But what does that signify? 
Not only under ground are the brains of men 
Eaten by maggots. 
Life in itself 
Is nothing, 
An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs. 
It is not enough that yearly, down this hill, 
April 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers. 




Sweet Love, Sweet Thorn, When Lightly To My Heart 

Sweet love, sweet thorn, when lightly to my heart 
I took your thrust, whereby I since am slain, 
And lie disheveled in the grass apart, 
A sodden thing bedrenched by tears and rain, 
While rainy evening drips to misty night, 
And misty night to cloudy morning clears, 
And clouds disperse across the gathering light, 
And birds grow noisy, and the sun appears 
Had I bethought me then, sweet love, sweet thorn, 
How sharp an anguish even at the best, 
When all's requited and the future sworn, 
The happy Hour can leave within the breast, 
I had not so come running at the call 
Of one whoe loves me little, if at all. 




<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Tavern 

I'll keep a little tavern 
Below the high hill's crest, 
Wherein all grey-eyed people 
May set them down and rest. 

There shall be plates a-plenty, 
And mugs to melt the chill 
Of all the grey-eyed people 
Who happen up the hill. 

There sound will sleep the traveller, 
And dream his journey's end, 
But I will rouse at midnight 
The falling fire to tend. 

Aye, 'tis a curious fancy 
But all the good I know 
Was taught me out of two grey eyes 
A long time ago.

The Ballad Of The Harp-Weaver 

"Son," said my mother, 
When I was knee-high, 
"you've need of clothes to cover you, 
and not a rag have I. 

"There's nothing in the house 
To make a boy breeches, 
Nor shears to cut a cloth with, 
Nor thread to take stitches. 

"There's nothing in the house 
But a loaf-end of rye, 
And a harp with a woman's head 
Nobody will buy," 
And she began to cry. 

That was in the early fall. 
When came the late fall, 
"Son," she said, "the sight of you 
Makes your mother's blood crawl, 

"Little skinny shoulder-blades 
Sticking through your clothes! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And where you'll get a jacket from 
God above knows. 

"It's lucky for me, lad, 
Your daddy's in the ground, 
And can't see the way I let 
His son go around!" 
And she made a queer sound. 

That was in the late fall. 
When the winter came, 
I'd not a pair of breeches 
Nor a shirt to my name. 

I couldn't go to school, 
Or out of doors to play. 



And all the other little boys 
Passed our way. 

"Son," said my mother, 
"Come, climb into my lap, 
And I'll chafe your little bones 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
While you take a nap." 

And, oh, but we were silly 
For half and hour or more, 
Me with my long legs, 
Dragging on the floor, 

A-rock-rock-rocking 
To a mother-goose rhyme! 
Oh, but we were happy 
For half an hour's time! 

But there was I, a great boy, 
And what would folks say 
To hear my mother singing me 
To sleep all day, 
In such a daft way? 

Men say the winter 
Was bad that year; 
Fuel was scarce, 
And food was dear. 

A wind with a wolf's head 
Howled about our door, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And we burned up the chairs 
And sat upon the floor. 

All that was left us 
Was a chair we couldn't break, 
And the harp with a woman's head 
Nobody would take, 
For song or pity's sake. 

The night before Christmas 
I cried with cold, 



I cried myself to sleep 
Like a two-year old. 

And in the deep night 
I felt my mother rise, 
And stare down upon me 
With love in her eyes. 

I saw my mother sitting 
On the one good chair, 
A light falling on her 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
From I couldn't tell where. 

Looking nineteen, 
And not a day older, 
And the harp with a woman's head 
Leaned against her shoulder. 

Her thin fingers, moving 
In the thin, tall strings, 
Were weav-weav-weaving 
Wonderful things. 

Many bright threads, 
From where I couldn't see, 
Were running through the harp-strings 
Rapidly, 

And gold threads whistling 
Through my mother's hand. 
I saw the web grow, 
And the pattern expand. 

She wove a child's jacket, 
And when it was done 
She laid it on the floor 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And wove another one. 

She wove a red cloak 
So regal to see, 
"She's made it for a king's son," 
I said, "and not for me." 



But I knew it was for me. 

She wove a pair of breeches 
Quicker than that! 
She wove a pair of boots 
And a little cocked hat. 

She wove a pair of mittens, 
Shw wove a little blouse, 
She wove all night 
In the still, cold house. 

She sang as she worked, 
And the harp-strings spoke; 
Her voice never faltered, 
And the thread never broke, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And when I awoke, 

There sat my mother 
With the harp against her shoulder, 
Looking nineteeen, 
And not a day older, 

A smile about her lips, 
And a light about her head, 
And her hands in the harp-strings 
Frozen dead. 

And piled beside her 
And toppling to the skies, 
Were the clothes of a king's son, 
Just my size. 




The Bean-Stalk 

Ho, Giant! This is I! 
I have built me a bean-stalk into your sky! 
La,but it's lovely, up so high! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

This is how I came,I put 
Here my knee, there my foot, 
Up and up, from shoot to shoot 
And the blessed bean-stalk thinning 
Like the mischief all the time, 
Till it took me rocking, spinning, 
In a dizzy, sunny circle, 
Making angles with the root, 
Far and out above the cackle 
Of the city I was born in, 
Till the little dirty city 
In the light so sheer and sunny 
Shone as dazzling bright and pretty 
As the money that you find 
In a dream of finding money 
What a wind! What a morning! 

Till the tiny, shiny city, 
When I shot a glance below, 
Shaken with a giddy laughter, 
Sick and blissfully afraid, 
Was a dew-drop on a blade, 
And a pair of moments after 
Was the whirling guess I made, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the wind was like a whip 

Cracking past my icy ears, 
And my hair stood out behind, 
And my eyes were full of tears, 
Wide-open and cold, 
More tears than they could hold, 
The wind was blowing so, 
And my teeth were in a row, 
Dry and grinning, 
And I felt my foot slip, 



And I scratched the wind and whined, 
And I clutched the stalk and jabbered, 
With my eyes shut blind, 
What a wind! What a wind! 

Your broad sky, Giant, 
Is the shelf of a cupboard; 
I make bean-stalks, I'm 
A builder, like yourself, 
But bean-stalks is my trade, 
I couldn't make a shelf, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Don't know how they're made, 
Now, a bean-stalk is more pliant 
La, what a climb! 




The Betrothal

 Oh, come, my lad, or go, my lad, 
And love me if you like. 
I shall not hear the door shut 
Nor the knocker strike. 
Oh, bring me gifts or beg me gifts, 
And wed me if you will. 
I'd make a man a good wife, 
Sensible and still. 
And why should I be cold, my lad,

 And why should you repine, 
Because I love a dark head 
That never will be mine? 

I might as well be easing you 
As lie alone in bed 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And waste the night in wanting 
A cruel dark head. 

You might as well be calling yours 
What never will be his, 
And one of us be happy. 
There's few enough as is. 




The Blue-Flag In The Bog 

God had called us, and we came; 
Our loved Earth to ashes left; 
Heaven was a neighbor's house, 
Open to us, bereft. 

Gay the lights of Heaven showed, 
And 'twas God who walked ahead; 
Yet I wept along the road, 
Wanting my own house instead. 

Wept unseen, unheeded cried, 
"All you things my eyes have kissed, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Fare you well! We meet no more, 
Lovely, lovely tattered mist! 

Weary wings that rise and fall 
All day long above the fire!" 
Red with heat was every wall, 
Rough with heat was every wire 

"Fare you well, you little winds 
That the flying embers chase! 
Fare you well, you shuddering day, 
With your hands before your face! 

And, ah, blackened by strange blight, 
Or to a false sun unfurled, 
Now forevermore goodbye, 
All the gardens in the world! 

On the windless hills of Heaven, 
That I have no wish to see, 
White, eternal lilies stand, 
By a lake of ebony. 

But the Earth forevermore 
Is a place where nothing grows, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Dawn will come, and no bud break; 
Evening, and no blossom close. 



Spring will come, and wander slow 
Over an indifferent land, 
Stand beside an empty creek, 
Hold a dead seed in her hand." 

God had called us, and we came, 
But the blessed road I trod 
Was a bitter road to me, 
And at heart I questioned God. 

"Though in Heaven," I said, "be all 
That the heart would most desire, 
Held Earth naught save souls of sinners 
Worth the saving from a fire? 

Withered grass,the wasted growing! 
Aimless ache of laden boughs!" 
Little things God had forgotten 
Called me, from my burning house. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
"Though in Heaven," I said, "be all 
That the eye could ask to see, 
All the things I ever knew 
Are this blaze in back of me." 

"Though in Heaven," I said, "be all 
That the ear could think to lack, 
All the things I ever knew 
Are this roaring at my back." 

It was God who walked ahead, 
Like a shepherd to the fold; 
In his footsteps fared the weak, 
And the weary and the old, 

Glad enough of gladness over, 
Ready for the peace to be, 
But a thing God had forgotten 
Was the growing bones of me. 

And I drew a bit apart, 



And I lagged a bit behind, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And I thought on Peace Eternal, 
Lest He look into my mind: 

And I gazed upon the sky, 
And I thought of Heavenly Rest, 
And I slipped away like water 
Through the fingers of the blest! 

All their eyes were fixed on Glory, 
Not a glance brushed over me; 
"Alleluia! Alleluia!" 
Up the road,and I was free. 

And my heart rose like a freshet, 
And it swept me on before, 
Giddy as a whirling stick, 
Till I felt the earth once more. 

All the earth was charred and black, 
Fire had swept from pole to pole; 
And the bottom of the sea 
Was as brittle as a bowl; 

And the timbered mountain-top 
Was as naked as a skull, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Nothing left, nothing left, 
Of the Earth so beautiful! 

"Earth," I said, "how can I leave you?" 
"You are all I have," I said; 
"What is left to take my mind up, 
Living always, and you dead?" 

"Speak!" I said, "Oh, tell me something! 
Make a sign that I can see! 
For a keepsake! To keep always! 
Quick!before God misses me!" 

And I listened for a voice; 
But my heart was all I heard; 
Not a screech-owl, not a loon, 



Not a tree-toad said a word. 

And I waited for a sign; 
Coals and cinders, nothing more; 
And a little cloud of smoke 
Floating on a valley floor. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

And I peered into the smoke 
Till it rotted, like a fog: 
There, encompassed round by fire, 
Stood a blue-flag in a bog! 

Little flames came wading out, 
Straining, straining towards its stem, 
But it was so blue and tall 
That it scorned to think of them! 

Red and thirsty were their tongues, 
As the tongues of wolves must be, 
But it was so blue and tall 
Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see! 

All my heart became a tear, 
All my soul became a tower, 
Never loved I anything 
As I loved that tall blue flower! 

It was all the little boats 
That had ever sailed the sea, 
It was all the little books 
That had gone to school with me; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

On its roots like iron claws 
Rearing up so blue and tall, 
It was all the gallant Earth 
With its back against a wall! 

In a breath, ere I had breathed, 
Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see! 
I was kneeling at its side, 
And it leaned its head on me! 



Crumbling stones and sliding sand 
Is the road to Heaven now; 
Icy at my straining knees 
Drags the awful under-tow; 

Soon but stepping-stones of dust 
Will the road to Heaven be, 
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, 
Reach a hand and rescue me! 

"Therethere, my blue-flag flower; 
Hushhushgo to sleep; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That is only God you hear, 
Counting up His folded sheep! 

Lullabyelullabye 
That is only God that calls, 
Missing me, seeking me, 
Ere the road to nothing falls! 

He will set His mighty feet 
Firmly on the sliding sand; 
Like a little frightened bird 
I will creep into His hand; 

I will tell Him all my grief, 
I will tell Him all my sin; 
He will give me half His robe 
For a cloak to wrap you in. 

Lullabyelullabye" 
Rocks the burnt-out planet free! 
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, 
Reach a hand and rescue me! 

Ah, the voice of love at last! 
Lo, at last the face of light! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the whole of His white robe 
For a cloak against the night! 

And upon my heart asleep 
All the things I ever knew! 



"Holds Heaven not some cranny, Lord, 
For a flower so tall and blue?" 

All's well and all's well! 
Gay the lights of Heaven show! 
In some moist and Heavenly place 
We will set it out to grow. 




The Concert 

No, I will go alone. 
I will come back when it's over. 
Yes, of course I love you. 
No, it will not be long. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Why may you not come with me? 
You are too much my lover. 
You would put yourself 
Between me and song. 

If I go alone, 
Quiet and suavely clothed, 
My body will die in its chair, 
And over my head a flame, 
A mind that is twice my own, 
Will mark with icy mirth 
The wise advance and retreat 
Of armies without a country, 
Storming a nameless gate, 
Hurling terrible javelins down 
From the shouting walls of a singing town 

Where no women wait! 
Armies clean of love and hate, 
Marching lines of pitiless sound 
Climbing hills to the sun and hurling 
Golden spears to the ground! 
Up the lines a silver runner 
Bearing a banner whereon is scored 
The milk and steel of a bloodless wound 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Healed at length by the sword! 

You and I have nothing to do with music. 
We may not make of music a filigree frame, 
Within which you and I, 
Tenderly glad we came, 
Sit smiling, hand in hand. 

Come now, be content. 
I will come back to you, I swear I will; 



And you will know me still. 
I shall be only a little taller 
Than when I went. 




The Courage That My Mother Had 

The courage that my mother had 
Went with her, and is with her still: 
Rock from New England quarried; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Now granite in a granite hill. 

The golden brooch my mother wore 
She left behind for me to wear; 
I have no thing I treasure more: 
Yet, it is something I could spare. 

Oh, if instead she'd left to me 

The thing she took into the grave!— 
That courage like a rock, which she 
Has no more need of, and I have. 




The Curse 

Oh, lay my ashes on the wind 
That blows across the sea. 
And I shall meet a fisherman 
Out of Capri, 

And he will say, seeing me, 
"What a Strange Thing! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Like a fish's scale or a 
Butterfly's wing." 

Oh, lay my ashes on the wind 
That blows away the fog. 
And I shall meet a farmer boy 
Leaping through the bog, 

And he will say, seeing me, 
"What a Strange Thing! 
Like a peat-ash or a 
Butterfly's wing." 

And I shall blow to YOUR house 
And, sucked against the pane, 
See you take your sewing up 
And lay it down again. 

And you will say, seeing me, 
"What a strange thing! 
Like a plum petal or a 
Butterfly's wing." 

And none at all will know me 
That knew me well before. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But I will settle at the root 
That climbs about your door, 

And fishermen and farmers 
May see me and forget, 
But I'll be a bitter berry 
In your brewing yet. 






The Death Of Autumn 

When reeds are dead and a straw to thatch the marshes, 
And feathered pampas-grass rides into the wind 
Like aged warriors westward, tragic, thinned 
Of half their tribe, and over the flattened rushes, 
Stripped of its secret, open, stark and bleak, 
Blackens afar the half-forgotten creek, 
Then leans on me the weight of the year, and crushes 
My heart. I know that Beauty must ail and die, 
And will be born again,but ah, to see 
Beauty stiffened, staring up at the sky! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Oh, Autumn! Autumn!What is the Spring to me? 




The Dream 

Love, if I weep it will not matter, 
And if you laugh I shall not care; 

Foolish am I to think about it, 
But it is good to feel you there. 

Love, in my sleep I dreamed of waking, 
White and awful the moonlight reached 

Over the floor, and somewhere, somewhere, 
There was a shutter loose,it screeched! 

Swung in the wind,and no wind blowing! 
I was afraid, and turned to you, 

Put out my hand to you for comfort, 
And you were gone! Cold, cold as dew, 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Under my hand the moonlight lay! 
Love, if you laugh I shall not care, 

But if I weep it will not matter, 
Ah, it is good to feel you there! 




The Fawn 

There it was I saw what I shall never forget 
And never retrieve. 
Monstrous and beautiful to human eyes, hard to 
believe, 
He lay, yet there he lay, 
Asleep on the moss, his head on his polished cleft 
small ebony hoves, 
The child of the doe, the dappled child of the deer. 

Surely his mother had never said, "Lie here 
Till I return," so spotty and plain to see 
On the green moss lay he. 
His eyes had opened; he considered me. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I would have given more than I care to say 
To thrifty ears, might I have had him for my friend 
One moment only of that forest day: 

Might I have had the acceptance, not the love 
Of those clear eyes; 
Might I have been for him in the bough above 
Or the root beneath his forest bed, 
A part of the forest, seen without surprise. 

Was it alarm, or was it the wind of my fear lest he 
depart 
That jerked him to his jointy knees, 
And sent him crashing off, leaping and stumbling 
On his new legs, between the stems of the white 
trees? 




The Fledgling 

So, art thou feahered, art thou flown, 
Thou naked thing?and canst alone 
Upon the unsolid summer air 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Sustain thyself, and prosper there? 
Shall no more with anxious note 
Advise thee through the happy day, 
Thrusting the worm into thy throat, 
Bearing thine excrement away? 
Alas, I think I see thee yet, 
Perched on the windy parapet, 
Defer thy flight a moment still 
To clean thy wing with careful bill. 
And thou are feathered, thou art flown; 
And hast a project of thine own. 




The Goose-Girl 

Spring rides no horses down the hill, 
But comes on foot, a goose-girl still. 
And all the loveliest things there be 
Come simply, so, it seems to me. 
If ever I said, in grief or pride, 
I tired of honest things, I lied: 
And should be cursed forevermore 
With Love in laces, like a whore, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And neighbours cold, and friends unsteady, 
And Spring on horseback, like a lady! 




The Leaf And The Tree 

When will you learn, myself, to be 
a dying leaf on a living tree? 
Budding, swelling, growing strong, 
Wearing green, but not for long, 
Drawing sustenance from air, 
That other leaves, and you not there, 
May bud, and at the autumn's call 
Wearing russet, ready to fall? 
Has not this trunk a deed to do 
Unguessed by small and tremulous you? 
Shall not these branches in the end 
To wisdom and the truth ascend? 
And the great lightning plunging by 
Look sidewise with a golden eye 
To glimpse a tree so tall and proud 
It sheds its leaves upon a cloud? 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Here, I think, is the heart's grief: 
The tree, no mightier than the leaf, 
Makes firm its root and spreads it crown 
And stands; but in the end comes down. 
That airy top no boy could climb 

Is trodden in a little time 
By cattle on their way to drink. 
The fluttering thoughts a leaf can think, 
That hears the wind and waits its turn, 
Have taught it all a tree can learn. 
Time can make soft that iron wood. 
The tallest trunk that ever stood, 
In time, without a dream to keep, 
Crawls in beside the root to sleep. 




The Little Ghost 

I knew her for a little ghost 
That in my garden walked; 
The wall is highhigher than most 
And the green gate was locked. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

And yet I did not think of that 
Till after she was gone 
I knew her by the broad white hat, 
All ruffled, she had on. 

By the dear ruffles round her feet, 
By her small hands that hung 
In their lace mitts, austere and sweet, 
Her gown's white folds among. 

I watched to see if she would stay, 
What she would doand oh! 
She looked as if she liked the way 
I let my garden grow! 

She bent above my favourite mint 
With conscious garden grace, 
She smiled and smiledthere was no hint 
Of sadness in her face. 

She held her gown on either side 
To let her slippers show, 
And up the walk she went with pride, 
The way great ladies go. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

And where the wall is built in new 
And is of ivy bare 
She pausedthen opened and passed through 
A gate that once was there. 




The Little Hill 

Oh, here the air is sweet and still, 
And soft's the grass to lie on; 
And far away's the little hill 
They took for Christ to die on. 

And there's a hill across the brook, 
And down the brook's another; 
But, oh, the little hill they took, 
I think I am its mother! 

The moon that saw Gethsemane, 
I watch it rise and set: 
It has so many things to see, 
They help it to forget. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

But little hills that sit at home 
So many hundred years, 
Remember Greece, remember Rome, 
Remember Mary's tears. 

And far away in Palestine, 
Sadder than any other, 
Grieves still the hill that I call mine, 
I think I am its mother! 




The Penitent 

I had a little Sorrow, 
Born of a little Sin, 
I found a room all damp with gloom 
And shut us all within; 
And, "Little Sorrow, weep," said I, 
"And, Little Sin, pray God to die, 
And I upon the floor will lie 
And think how bad I've been!" 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Alas for pious planning 
It mattered not a whit! 
As far as gloom went in that room, 
The lamp might have been lit! 
My little Sorrow would not weep, 
My little Sin would go to sleep 
To save my soul I could not keep 
My graceless mind on it! 

So I got up in anger, 
And took a book I had, 
And put a ribbon on my hair 
To please a passing lad, 
And, "One thing there's no getting by 
I've been a wicked girl," said I: 
"But if I can't be sorry, why, 
I might as well be glad!" 




The Philosopher 

And what are you that, wanting you, 
I should be kept awake 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
As many nights as there are days 
With weeping for your sake? 

And what are you that, missing you, 
As many days as crawl 
I should be listening to the wind 
And looking at the wall? 

I know a man that's a braver man 
And twenty men as kind, 
And what are you, that you should be 
The one man in my mind? 

Yet women's ways are witless ways, 
As any sage will tell, 
And what am I, that I should love 
So wisely and so well? 




The Plaid Dress 

Strong sun, that bleach 
The curtains of my room, can you not render 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Colourless this dress I wear? 
This violent plaid 
Of purple angers and red shames; the yellow stripe 
Of thin but valid treacheries; the flashy green of kind deeds done 
Through indolence high judgments given here in haste; 
The recurring checker of the serious breach of taste? 

No more uncoloured than unmade, 
I fear, can be this garment that I may not doff; 
Confession does not strip it off, 
To send me homeward eased and bare; 

All through the formal, unoffending evening, under the clean 
Bright hair, 
Lining the subtle gown. . .it is not seen, 
But it is there. 




The Poet And His Book 

Down, you mongrel, Death! 
Back into your kennel! 
I have stolen breath 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In a stalk of fennel! 
You shall scratch and you shall whine 
Many a night, and you shall worry 
Many a bone, before you bury 
One sweet bone of mine! 

When shall I be dead? 
When my flesh is withered, 
And above my head 
Yellow pollen gathered 
All the empty afternoon? 
When sweet lovers pause and wonder 
Whom am I that lie thereunder, 
Hidden from the moon? 

This my personal death? 
That my lungs be failing 
To inhale the breath 
Others are exhaling? 
This my subtle spirit's end? 
Ah, when the thawed winter splashes 
Over these chance dust and ashes, 
Weep not me, my friend! 

Me, by no means dead 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In that hour, but surely 
When this book, unread, 
Rots to earth obscurely, 
And no more to any breast, 
Close against the clamorous swelling 
Of the thing there is no telling, 
Are these pages pressed! 

When this book is mould, 
And a book of many 
Waiting to be sold 



For a casual penny, 
In a little open case, 
In a street unclean and cluttered, 
Where a heavy mud is spattered 
From the passing drays, 

Stranger, pause and look; 
From the dust of ages 
Lift this little book, 
Turn the tattered pages, 
Read me, do not let me die! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Search the fading letters, finding 
Steadfast in the broken binding 
All that once was I! 

When these veins are weeds, 
When these hollowed sockets 
Watch the rooty seeds 
Bursting down like rockets, 
And surmise the spring again, 
Or, remote in that black cupboard, 
Watch the pink worms writhing upward 
At the smell of rain, 

Boys and girls that lie 
Whispering in the hedges, 
Do not let me die, 
Mix me with your pledges; 
Boys and girls that slowly walk 
In the woods, and weep, and quarrel, 
Staring past the pink wild laurel, 
Mix me with your talk, 

Do not let me die! 
Farmers at your raking, 
When the sun is high, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
While the hay is making, 
When, along the stubble strewn, 
Withering on their stalks uneaten, 
Strawberries turn dark and sweeten 
In the lapse of noon; 



Shepherds on the hills, 
In the pastures, drowsing 
To the tinkling bells 
Of the brown sheep browsing; 
Sailors cying through the storm; 
Scholars at your study; hunters 
Lost amid the whirling winter's 
Whiteness uniform; 

Men that long to sleep; 
Men that wake and revel; 
If an old song leap 
To your senses' level 
At such moments, may it be 
Sometimes, though a moment only, 
Some forgotten, quaint and homely 
Vehicle of me? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Women at your toil, 
Women at your leisure, 
Till the kettle boil, 
Snatch of me your pleasure, 
Where the broom-straw marks the leaf; 
Women quiet with your weeping 
Lest you wake a workman sleeping, 
Mix me with your grief. 

Boys and girls that steal 
From the shocking laughter 
Of the old, to kneel 
By a dripping rafter 
Under the discoloured eaves, 
Out of trunks with hingeless covers 
Lifting tales of saints and lovers, 
Travellers, goblins, theives, 

Suns that shine by night, 
Mountains made from valleys, 
Bear me to the light, 
Flat upon your bellies 
By the webby window lie, 
Where the little flies are crawling, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>



Read me, margin me with scrawling, 
Do no let me die! 

Sexton, ply your trade! 
In a shower of gravel 
Stamp upon your spade! 
Many a rose shall ravel, 
Many a metal wreath shall rust 
In the rain, and I go singing 
Through the lots where you are flinging 
Yellow clay on dust! 




The Prisoner 

ALL right, 
Go ahead! 
What's in a name? 
I guess I'll be locked into 
As much as I'm locked out of! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>




The Return From Town 

As I sat down by Saddle Stream 
To bathe my dusty feet there, 
A boy was standing on the bridge 
Any girl would meet there. 

As I went over Woody Knob 
A youth was coming up the hill 
Any maid would follow. 

Then in I turned at my own gate, 
And nothing to be sad for 
To such a man as any WIFE 
Would pass a pretty lad for. 




The Shroud 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Death, I say, my heart is bowed 
Unto thine,O mother! 

This red gown will make a shroud 
Good as any other! 

(I, that would not wait to wear 
My own bridal things, 

In a dress dark as my hair 
Made my answerings. 

I, to-night, that till he came 
Could not, could not wait, 
In a gown as bright as flame 
Held for them the gate. ) 

Death, I say, my heart is bowed 
Unto thine,O mother! 

This red gown will make a shroud 
Good as any other!

The Singing-Woman From The Wood's Edge 

What should I be but a prophet and a liar, 
Whose mother was a leprechaun, whose father was a friar? 
Teethed on a crucifix and cradled under water, 
What should I be but the fiend's god-daughter? 

And who should be my playmates but the adder and the frog, 
That was got beneath a furze-bush and born in a bog? 
And what should be my singing, that was christened at an altar, 
But Aves and Credos and Psalms out of the Psalter? 

You will see such webs on the wet grass, maybe, 
As a pixie-mother weaves for her baby, 
You will find such flame at the wave's weedy ebb 
As flashes in the meshes of a mer-mother's web, 

But there comes to birth no common spawn 
From the love a a priest for a leprechaun, 
And you never have seen and you never will see 
Such things as the things that swaddled me! 

After all's said and after all's done, 
What should I be but a harlot and a nun? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

In through the bushes, on any foggy day, 
My Da would come a-swishing of the drops away, 
With a prayer for my death and a groan for my birth, 
A-mumbling of his beads for all that he was worth. 

And there'd sit my Ma, with her knees beneath her chin, 
A-looking in his face and a-drinking of it in, 
And a-marking in the moss some funny little saying 
That would mean just the opposite of all that he was praying! 

He taught me the holy-talk of Vesper and of Matin, 
He heard me my Greek and he heard me my Latin, 
He blessed me and crossed me to keep my soul from evil, 
And we watched him out of sight, and we conjured up the devil! 

Oh, the things I haven't seen and the things I haven't known, 



What with hedges and ditches till after I was grown, 
And yanked both way by my mother and my father, 
With a "Which would you better?" and a " Which would you 
rather?" 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
With him for a sire and her for a dam, 
What should I be but just what I am? 




The Snow Storm 

No hawk hangs over in this air: 
The urgent snow is everywhere. 
The wing adroiter than a sail 
Must lean away from such a gale, 
Abandoning its straight intent, 
Or else expose tough ligament 
And tender flesh to what before 
Meant dampened feathers, nothing more. 
Forceless upon our backs there fall 
Infrequent flakes hexagonal, 
Devised in many a curious style 
To charm our safety for a while, 
Where close to earth like mice we go 
Under the horizontal snow.

The Spring And The Fall 

In the spring of the year, in the spring of the year, 
I walked the road beside my dear. 
The trees were black where the bark was wet. 
I see them yet, in the spring of the year. 
He broke me a bough of the blossoming peach 
That was out of the way and hard to reach. 

In the fall of the year, in the fall of the year, 
I walked the road beside my dear. 
The rooks went up with a raucous trill. 
I hear them still, in the fall of the year. 
He laughed at all I dared to praise, 
And broke my heart, in little ways. 

Year be springing or year be falling, 
The bark will drip and the birds be calling. 
There's much that's fine to see and hear 
In the spring of a year, in the fall of a year. 
'Tis not love's going hurt my days. 
But that it went in little ways.

The Suicide 

"Curse thee, Life, I will live with thee no more! 
Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore! 
And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me, 
I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly 
That I might eat again, and met thy sneers 
With deprecations, and thy blows with tears, 
Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away, 
As if spent passion were a holiday! 
And now I go. Nor threat, nor easy vow 
Of tardy kindness can avail thee now 
With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown; 
Lonely I came, and I depart alone, 
And know not where nor unto whom I go; 
But that thou canst not follow me I know." 

Thus I to Life, and ceased; but through my brain 
My thought ran still, until I spake again: 

"Ah, but I go not as I came,no trace 
Is mine to bear away of that old grace 
I brought! I have been heated in thy fires, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires, 
Thy mark is on me! I am not the same 
Nor ever more shall be, as when I came. 
Ashes am I of all that once I seemed. 
In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed 
Is wakeful for alarm,oh, shame to thee, 
For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me, 
Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing 
Ah, Life, I would have been a pleasant thing 
To have about the house when I was grown 
If thou hadst left my little joys alone! 
I asked of thee no favor save this one: 
That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun! 
And this thou didst deny, calling my name 
Insistently, until I rose and came. 
I saw the sun no more.It were not well 
So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell, 
Need I arise to-morrow and renew 



Again my hated tasks, but I am through 
With all things save my thoughts and this one night, 
So that in truth I seem already quite 
Free,and remote from thee,I feel no haste 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And no reluctance to depart; I taste 
Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught, 
That in a little while I shall have quaffed." 

Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled, 
Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed 
Before me one by one till once again 
I set new words unto an old refrain: 

"Treasures thou hast that never have been mine! 
Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine 
Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown 
Like blossoms out to me that sat alone! 
And I have waited well for thee to show 
If any share were mine,and now I go 
Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain 
I shall but come into mine own again!" 

Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more, 
But turning, straightway, sought a certain door 
In the rear wall. Heavy it was, and low 
And dark,a way by which none e'er would go 
That other exit had, and never knock 
Was heard thereat,bearing a curious lock 
Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Whereof Life held content the useless key, 
And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust, 
Whose sudden voice across a silence must, 
I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear, 
A strange door, ugly like a dwarf.So near 
I came I felt upon my feet the chill 
Of acid wind creeping across the sill. 
So stood longtime, till over me at last 
Came weariness, and all things other passed 
To make it room; the still night drifted deep 
Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep. 

But, suddenly, marking the morning hour, 



Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower! 
Startled, I raised my head,and with a shout 
Laid hold upon the latch,and was without. 

* * * * 

Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road, 
Leading me back unto my old abode, 
My father's house! There in the night I came, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And found them feasting, and all things the same 
As they had been before. A splendour hung 
Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung 
As, echoing out of very long ago, 
Had called me from the house of Life, I know. 
So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame 
On the unlovely garb in which I came; 
Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked: 
"It is my father's house!" I said and knocked; 
And the door opened. To the shining crowd 
Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud, 
Seeing no face but his; to him I crept, 
And "Father!" I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept. 

* * * * 

Ah, days of joy that followed! All alone 
I wandered through the house. My own, my own, 
My own to touch, my own to taste and smell, 
All I had lacked so long and loved so well! 
None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song, 
Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long. 

I know not when the wonder came to me 
Of what my father's business might be, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And whither fared and on what errands bent 
The tall and gracious messengers he sent. 
Yet one day with no song from dawn till night 
Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight. 
And the next day I called; and on the third 
Asked them if I might go,but no one heard. 
Then, sick with longing, I arose at last 
And went unto my father,in that vast 



Chamber wherein he for so many years 

Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres. 

"Father," I said, "Father, I cannot play 

The harp that thou didst give me, and all day 

I sit in idleness, while to and fro 

About me thy serene, grave servants go; 

And I am weary of my lonely ease. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Better a perilous journey overseas 

Away from thee, than this, the life I lead, 

To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed 

That grows to naught,I love thee more than they 

Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way. 

Father, I beg of thee a little task 

To dignify my days,'tis all I ask 

Forever, but forever, this denied, 

I perish." 
"Child," my father's voice replied, 

"All things thy fancy hath desired of me 

Thou hast received. I have prepared for thee 

Within my house a spacious chamber, where 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Are delicate things to handle and to wear, 

And all these things are thine. Dost thou love song? 

My minstrels shall attend thee all day long. 

Or sigh for flowers? My fairest gardens stand 

Open as fields to thee on every hand. 

And all thy days this word shall hold the same: 

No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name. 

But as for tasks" he smiled, and shook his head; 

"Thou hadst thy task, and laidst it by," he said. 




The True Encounter 

"Wolf!" cried my cunning heart 
At every sheep it spied, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And roused the countryside. 

"Wolf! Wolf!"and up would start 
Good neighbours, bringing spade 
And pitchfork to my aid. 

At length my cry was known: 
Therein lay my release. 
I met the wolf alone 
And was devoured in peace. 




The Unexplorer 

There was a road ran past our house 
Too lovely to explore. 
I asked my mother onceshe said 
That if you followed where it led 
It brought you to the milk-man's door. 
(That's why I have not travelled more.) 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

The Wood Road 

If I were to walk this way 
Hand in hand with Grief, 
I should mark that maple-spray 
Coming into leaf. 
I should note how the old burrs 
Rot upon the ground. 
Yes, though Grief should know me hers 
While the world goes round, 
It could not if truth be said 
This was lost on me: 
A rock-maple showing red, 
Burrs beneath a tree. 




Think Not, Not For A Moment Let Your Mind 

Think not, not for a moment let your mind, 
Wearied with thinking, doze upon the thought 
That the work's done and the long day behind, 
And beauty, since 'tis paid for, can be bought. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
If in the moonlight from the silent bough 
Suddenly with precision speak your name 
The nightingale, be not assured that now 
His wing is limed and his wild virtue tame. 
Beauty beyond all feathers that have flown 
Is free; you shall not hood her to your wrist, 
Nor sting her eyes, nor have her for your own 
In an fashion; beauty billed and kissed 
Is not your turtle; tread her like a dove 
She loves you not; she never heard of love. 




Three Songs Of Shattering 

I 

The first rose on my rose-tree 
Budded, bloomed, and shattered, 
During sad days when to me 
Nothing mattered. 

Grief of grief has drained me clean; 
Still it seems a pity 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
No one saw,it must have been 
Very pretty.

 II 

Let the little birds sing; 
Let the little lambs play; 
Spring is here; and so 'tis spring; 
But not in the old way! 

I recall a place 
Where a plum-tree grew; 
There you lifted up your face, 
And blossoms covered you. 

If the little birds sing, 
And the little lambs play, 
Spring is here; and so 'tis spring 
But not in the old way!

 III 

All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree! 
Ere spring was goingah, spring is gone! 
And there comes no summer to the like of you and me, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Blossom time is early, but no fruit sets on. 

All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree, 
Browned at the edges, turned in a day; 
And I would with all my heart they trimmed a mound for me, 



 And weeds were tall on all the paths that led that way! 



Thursday 

And if I loved you Wednesday, 
Well, what is that to you? 
I do not love you Thursday So 
much is true. 

And why you come complaining 
Is more than I can see. 
I loved you Wednesday, - yes -but what 
Is that to me?

To A Poet That Died Young 

Minstrel, what have you to do 
With this man that, after you, 
Sharing not your happy fate, 
Sat as England's Laureate? 
Vainly, in these iron days, 
Strives the poet in your praise, 
Minstrel, by whose singing side 
Beauty walked, until you died. 

Still, though none should hark again, 
Drones the blue-fly in the pane, 
Thickly crusts the blackest moss, 
Blows the rose its musk across, 
Floats the boat that is forgot 
None the less to Camelot. 

Many a bard's untimely death 
Lends unto his verses breath; 
Here's a song was never sung: 
Growing old is dying young. 
Minstrel, what is this to you: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That a man you never knew, 
When your grave was far and green, 
Sat and gossipped with a queen? 

Thalia knows how rare a thing 
Is it, to grow old and sing; 
When a brown and tepid tide 
Closes in on every side. 
Who shall say if Shelley's gold 
Had withstood it to grow old? 




To A Young Poet 

Time cannot break the bird's wing from the bird. 
Bird and wing together 
Go down, one feather. 

No thing that ever flew, 
Not the lark, not you, 
Can die as others do. 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


To Kathleen 

Still must the poet as of old, 
In barren attic bleak and cold, 
Starve, freeze, and fashion verses to 
Such things as flowers and song and you; 

Still as of old his being give 
In Beauty's name, while she may live, 
Beauty that may not die as long 
As there are flowers and you and song. 




To The Not Impossible Him 

How shall I know, unless I go 
To Cairo and Cathay, 
Whether or not this blessed spot 
Is blest in every way? 

Now it may be, the flower for me 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Is this beneath my nose: 
How shall I tell, unless I smell 
The Carthaginian rose? 

The fabric of my faithful love 
No power shall dim or ravel 
Whilst I stay here,but oh, my dear, 
If I should ever travel! 




To Those Without Pity 

Cruel of heart, lay down my song, 
Your reading eyes have done me wrong, 
Not for you was the pen bitten, 
And the mind wrung, and the song written. 




Travel 

The railroad track is miles away,
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 And the day is loud with voices speaking, 
Yet there isn't a train goes by all day

 But I hear its whistle shrieking. 

All night there isn't a train goes by,

 Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming, 
But I see its cinders red on the sky,

 And hear its engine steaming. 

My heart is warm with friends I make,

 And better friends I'll not be knowing; 
Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take,

 No matter where it's going. 




Two Sonnets In Memory 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
(Nicola Sacco -- Bartolomeo Vanzetti) 
Executed August 23, 1927 

I 

As men have loved their lovers in times past 
And sung their wit, their virtue and their grace, 
So have we loved sweet Justice to the last, 
That now lies here in an unseemly place. 
The child will quit the cradle and grow wise 
And stare on beauty till his senses drown; 
Yet shall be seen no more by mortal eyes 
Such beauty as here walked and here went down. 
Like birds that hear the winter crying plain 
Her courtiers leave to seek the clement south; 
Many have praised her, we alone remain 
To break a fist against the lying mouth 
Of any man who says this was not so: 
Though she be dead now, as indeed we know. 

II 

Where can the heart be hidden in the ground 
And be at peace, and be at peace forever, 
Under the world, untroubled by the sound 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of mortal tears, that cease from pouring never? 
Well for the heart, by stern compassion harried, 
If death be deeper than the churchmen say, -Gone 
from this world indeed what's graveward carried, 
And laid to rest indeed what's laid away. 
Anguish enough while yet the indignant breather 
Have blood to spurt upon the oppressor's hand; 
Who would eternal be, and hang in ether 
A stuffless ghost above his struggling land, 
Retching in vain to render up the groan 
That is not there, being aching dust's alone? 






Underground System 

Set the foot down with distrust upon the crust of the 
worldit is thin. 
Moles are at work beneath us; they have tunneled the 
sub-soil 
With separate chambers; which at an appointed knock 
Could be as one, could intersect and interlock. We walk 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
on the skin 
Of life. No toil 
Of rake or hoe, no lime, no phosphate, no rotation of 
crops, no irrigation of the land, 
Will coax the limp and flattened grain to stand 
On that bad day, or feed to strength the nibbled root's of 
our nation. 
Ease has demoralized us, nearly so, we know 
Nothing of the rigours of winter: The house has a roof 
againstthe car a top againstthe snow. 
All will be well, we say, it is a bit, like the rising of the 
sun, 
For our country to prosper; who can prevail against us? 
No one. 
The house has a roof; but the boards of its floor are 
rotting, and hall upon hall 
The moles have built their palace beneath us, we have 
not far to fall. 




We Talk Of Taxes... 

We talk of taxes, and I call you friend; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Well, such you are, -- but well enough we know 
How thick about us root, how rankly grow 
Those subtle weeds no man has need to tend, 
That flourish through neglect, and soon must send 
Perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow 
Our steady senses; how such matters go 
We are aware, and how such matters end. 
Yet shall be told no meagre passion here; 
With lovers such as we forevermore 
Isolde drinks the draught, and Guinevere 
Receives the Table's ruin through her door, 
Francesca, with the loud surf at her ear, 
Lets fall the coloured book upon the floor. 




What Lips My Lips Have Kissed, And Where, And Why 
(Sonnet Xliii) 

What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, 
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain 
Under my head till morning; but the rain 
Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh 
Upon the glass and listen for reply, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain 
For unremembered lads that not again 
Will turn to me at midnight with a cry. 
Thus in winter stands the lonely tree, 
Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one, 
Yet knows its boughs more silent than before: 
I cannot say what loves have come and gone, 
I only know that summer sang in me 
A little while, that in me sings no more. 




When I Too Long Have Looked Upon Your Face 

When I too long have looked upon your face, 
Wherein for me a brightness unobscured 
Save by the mists of brightness has its place, 
And terrible beauty not to be endured, 
I turn away reluctant from your light, 
And stand irresolute, a mind undone, 
A silly, dazzled thing deprived of sight 
From having looked too long upon the sun. 
Then is my daily life a narrow room 
In which a little while, uncertainly, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Surrounded by impenetrable gloom, 
Among familiar things grown strange to me 
Making my way, I pause, and feel, and hark, 
Till I become accustomed to the dark. 




When The Year Grows Old 

I cannot but remember 
When the year grows old -October 
-- November -&
How she disliked the cold! 

She used to watch the swallows 
Go down across the sky, 
And turn from the window 
With a little sharp sigh. 

And often when the brown leaves 
Were brittle on the ground, 
And the wind in the chimney 
Made a melancholy sound, 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
She had a look about her 
That I wish I could forget -The 
look of a scared thing 
Sitting in a net! 

Oh, beautiful at nightfall 
The soft spitting snow! 
And beautiful the bare boughs 
Rubbing to and fro! 

But the roaring of the fire, 
And the warmth of fur, 
And the boiling of the kettle 
Were beautiful to her! 

I cannot but remember 
When the year grows old -October 
-- November -&
How she disliked the cold! 




When We Are Old And These Rejoicing Veins 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
When we are old and these rejoicing veins 
Are frosty channels to a muted stream, 
And out of all our burning their remains 
No feeblest spark to fire us, even in dream, 
This be our solace: that it was not said 
When we were young and warm and in our prime, 
Upon our couch we lay as lie the dead, 
Sleeping away the unreturning time. 
O sweet, O heavy-lidded, O my love, 
When morning strikes her spear upon the land, 
And we must rise and arm us and reprove 
The insolent daylight with a steady hand, 
Be not discountenanced if the knowing know 
We rose from rapture but an hour ago. 




Whereas At Morning In A Jeweled Crown 

Whereas at morning in a Jeweled Crown 
I bit my fingers and was hard to please, 
Having shook disaster till the fruit fell down 
I feel tonight more happy and at ease: 
Feet running in the corridors, men quick 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Buckling their sword-belts, bumping down the stair, 
Challenge, and rattling bridge-chain, and the click 
Of hooves on pavementthis will clear the air. 
Private this chamber as it has not been 
In many a month of muffled hours; almost, 
Lulled by the uproar, I could lie serene 
And sleep, until all's won, until all's lost, 
And the door's opened and the issue shown, 
And I walk forth Hell's Mistressor my own. 




Wild Swans 

I looked in my heart while the wild swans went over. 
And what did I see I had not seen before? 
Only a question less or a question more: 
Nothing to match the flight of wild birds flying. 
Tiresome heart, forever living and dying, 
House without air, I leave you and lock your door. 
Wild swans, come over the town, come over 
The town again, trailing your legs and crying! 


<|endoftext|>

Witch-Wife 

She is neither pink nor pale, 
And she never will be all mine; 
She learned her hands in a fairy-tale, 
And her mouth on a valentine. 

She has more hair than she needs; 
In the sun 'tis a woe to me! 
And her voice is a string of coloured beads, 
Or steps leading into the sea. 

She loves me all that she can, 
And her ways to my ways resign; 
But she was not made for any man, 
And she never will be all mine. 




Wraith 

"Thin Rain, whom are you haunting, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That you haunt my door?" 
Surely it is not I she's wanting; 
Someone living here before 
"Nobody's in the house but me: 
You may come in if you like and see." 

Thin as thread, with exquisite fingers, 
Have you seen her, any of you? 
Grey shawl, and leaning on the wind, 
And the garden showing through? 

Glimmering eyes,and silent, mostly, 
Sort of a whisper, sort of a purr, 
Asking something, asking it over, 
If you get a sound from her. 

Ever see her, any of you? 
Strangest thing I've ever known, 
Every night since I moved in, 
And I came to be alone. 

"Thin Rain, hush with your knocking! 
You may not come in! 
This is I that you hear rocking; 
Nobody's with me, nor has been!" 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Curious, how she tried the window, 
Odd, the way she tries the door, 
Wonder just what sort of people 
Could have had this house before . . .
