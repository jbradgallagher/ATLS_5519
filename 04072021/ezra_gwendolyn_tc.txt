[greek] 

Be in me as the eternal moods 
of the bleak wind, and not 
As transient things are— 
gaiety of flowers. 
Have me in the strong loneliness 
of sunless cliffs 
And of gray waters. 
Let the gods speak softly of us 
In days hereafter, 
the shadowy flowers of Orcus 
Remember thee. 




‘phasellus Ille’ 

1 his papier-mâché, which you see, my friends, 
Saith 'twas the worthiest of editors. 
Its mind was made up in 'the seventies', 
Nor hath it ever since changed that concoction. 
It works to represent that school of thought 
Which brought the hair-cloth chair to such perfection, 
Nor will the horrid threats of Bernard Shaw 
Shake up the stagnant pool of its convictions; 
Nay, should the deathless voice of all the world 
Speak once again for its sole stimulation, 
Twould not move it one jot from left to right. 

Come Beauty barefoot from the Cyclades, 
She'd find a model for St. Anthony 
In this thing's sure decorum and behaviour. 




A Ballad Of The Mulberry Road 

The sun rises in south east corner of things 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To look on the tall house of the Shin 
For they have a daughter named Rafu, 
(pretty girl) 
She made the name for herself: 'Gauze Veil,' 
For she feeds mulberries to silkworms. 
She gets them by the south wall of the town. 
With green strings she makes the warp of her basket, 
She makes the shoulder-straps of her basket 
from the boughs of Katsura, 
And she piles her hair up on the left side of her headpiece. 

Her earrings are made of pearl, 
Her underskirt is of green pattern-silk, 
Her overskirt is the same silk dyed in purple, 
And when men going by look on Rafu 
They set down their burdens, 
They stand and twirl their moustaches. 




A Girl 

The tree has entered my hands, 
The sap has ascended my arms, 
The tree has grown in my breast Downward, 
The branches grow out of me, like arms. 

Tree you are, 
Moss you are, 
You are violets with wind above them. 
A child - so high - you are, 
And all this is folly to the world.

A Pact 

I make a pact with you, Walt Whitman I 
have detested you long enough. 
I come to you as a grown child 
Who has had a pig-headed father; 
I am old enough now to make friends. 
It was you that broke the new wood, 
Now is a time for carving. 
We have one sap and one root Let 
there be commerce between us. 




A Song Of The Degrees 

I 
Rest me with Chinese colours, 
For I think the glass is evil. 

II 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The wind moves above the wheat-
With a silver crashing, 
A thin war of metal. 

I have known the golden disc, 
I have seen it melting above me. 
I have known the stone-bright place, 
The hall of clear colours. 

III 
O glass subtly evil, O confusion of colours ! 
O light bound and bent in, soul of the captive, 
Why am I warned? Why am I sent away? 
Why is your glitter full of curious mistrust? 
O glass subtle and cunning, O powdery gold! 
O filaments of amber, two-faced iridescence! 




A Villonaud: Ballad Of The Gibbet 

SCENE: 'En ce bourdel ou tenons nostre estat.' 

It being remembered that there were six of us with Master Villon, when 
that expecting presently lo be hanged he writ a ballad whereof ye know: 

‘Freres humains qui apres nous vivez.' 

Drink ye a skoal for the gallows tree! 
Francois and Margot and thee and me, 
Drink we the comrades merrily 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That said us, 'Till then' for the gallows tree! 

Fat Pierre with the hook gauche-main, 
Thomas Larron 'Ear-the-less', 
Tybalde and that armouress 
Who gave this poignard its premier stain 
Pinning the Guise that had been fain 
To make him a mate of the 'Haulte Noblesse' 
And bade her be out with ill address 
As a fool that mocketh his drue's disdeign. 

Drink we a skoal for the gallows tree! 
Francois and Margot and thee and me, 
Drink we to Marienne Ydole, 
That hell brenn not her o'er cruelly. 

Drink we the lusty robbers twain, 
Black is the pitch o' their wedding dress, 
Lips shrunk back for the wind's caress 
As lips shrink back when we feel the strain 

Of love that loveth in hell's disdeign, 
And sense the teeth through the lips that press 
'Gainst our lips for the soul's distress 
That striveth to ours across the pain. 

Drink we skoal to the gallows tree! 
Francois and Margot and thee and me, 
For Jehan and Raoul de Vallerie 



Whose frames have the night and its winds in fee. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Maturin, Guillaume, Jacques d'Allmain, 
Culdou lacking a coat to bless 
One lean moiety of his nakedness 
That plundered St. Hubert back o' the fane: 
Aie! the lean bare tree is widowed again 
For Michault le Borgne that would confess 
In 'faith and troth' to a traitoress, 
'Which of his brothers had he slain?' 

But drink we skoal to the gallows tree! 
Francois and Margot and thee and me: 

These that we loved shall God love less 
And smite always at their faibleness? 

Skoal!! to the gallows! and then pray we: 
God damn his hell out speedily 
And bring their souls to his 'Haulte Citee'. 




A Virginal 

No, no! Go from me. I have left her lately. 
I will not spoil my sheath with lesser brightness, 
For my surrounding air hath a new lightness; 
Slight are her arms, yet they have bound me straitly 
And left me cloaked as with a gauze of aether; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
As with sweet leaves; as with subtle clearness. 
Oh, I have picked up magic in her nearness 
To sheathe me half in half the things that sheathe her. 
No, no! Go from me. I have still the flavour, 
Soft as spring wind that's come from birchen bowers. 
Green come the shoots, aye April in the branches, 
As winter's wound with her sleight hand she staunches, 
Hath of the trees a likeness of the savour: 
As white their bark, so white this lady's hours. 




Alba 

As cool as the pale wet leaves 
      of lily-of-the-valley 
She lay beside me in the dawn. 




Albatre 

This lady in the white bath-robe which she calls a 
peignoir, 
Is, for the time being, the mistress of my friend, 
And the delicate white feet of her little white dog 
Are not more delicate than she is, 
Nor would Gautier himself have despised their contrasts 
in whiteness 
As she sits in the great chair 
Between the two indolent candles.

Alf’s Eighth Bit 

Vex not thou the banker's mind 
(His what?) with a show of sense, 
Vex it not, Willie, his mind, 
Or pierce its pretence 
On the supposition that it ever 
Was other, or that this cheerful giver 
Will give, save to the blind. 

Come not anear the dark-browed sophist 
Who on the so well-paid ground 
Will cheerfully tell you a fist is no fist, 
Come not here 
With 2 and 2 making 4 in reason, 
Knowest thou not the truth is never in season 
In these quarters or Fleet St.? 

In his eye there is death, I mean the banker's, 
In his purse there is deceit, 
It is he who buys gold-braid for the swankers 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And gives you Australian iced rabbits' meat 
In place of the roast beef of Britain, 
And leaves you a park bench to sit on 
If you git off the Embankment. 

This is the kind of tone and Solemnity 
That used to be used on the young, 
My old man got no indemnity 
But he swaller'd his tongue. 
Like all his class was told to hold it in those days, 
To mind their ‘p’s’ and their ‘q’s’ and their ways 
An' be thankful for occasional holidays. 

I don't quite see the joke any more, 
Or why we should stand to attention 
And lick the dirt off the floor 
In the hope of honourable mention 
From a great employer like Selfridge 
Or a buyer of space in the papers. 
I'm getting too old for such capers. 






Alf’s Fifth Bit 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

The pomps of butchery, financial power, 
Told 'em to die in war, and then to save, 
Then cut their saving to the half or lower; 
When will this system lie down in its grave? 

The pomps of Fleet St., festering year on year, 
Hid truth and lied, and lied and hid the facts. 
The pimps of Whitehall ever more in fear, 
Hid health statistics, dodged the Labour Acts. 

All drew their pay, and as the pay grew less, 
The money rotten and more rotten yet, 
Hid more statistics, more feared to confess 
C.3, C.4, 'twere better to forget 

How many weak of mind, how much tuberculosis 
Filled the back alleys and the back to back houses. 
'The medical report this week discloses . . .' 
'Time for that question!' Front Bench interposes. 

Time for that question? and the time is NOW. 
Who ate the profits, and who locked 'em in 
The unsafe safe, wherein all rots, and no man can say how 
What was the nation's, now by Norman's kin 
Is one day blown up large, the next, ducked in? 




Alf’s Fourth Bit 

Rudyard the dud yard, 
Rudyard the false measure, 
Told 'em that glory 
Ain't always a pleasure, 
But said it wuz glorious nevertheless 
To lick the boots of the bloke 
That makes the worst mess. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Keep up the grand system 
Don't tell what you know, 
Your grandad got the rough edge. 
Ain't it always been so ? 
Your own ma' warn't no better 
Than the Duchess of Kaugh. 
My cousin's named Baldwin 
An' 'e looks like a tofft 

You 'ark to the sargent, 
And don't read no books; 
Go to God like a sojer; 
What counts is the looks. 




Alf’s Ninth Bit 

Listen, my children, and you shall hear 
The midnight activities of Whats-his Name, 
Scarcely a general now known to fame 
Can tell you of that famous day and year. 

When feeble Mr. Asquith, getting old, 
The destinies of England were almost sold 
To a Welsh shifter with an ogling eye, 
And Whats-his-name attained nobility. 

The Dashing Rupert of the pulping trade, 
Rough from the virgin forests inviolate, 
Thus rose in Albion, and tickled the State 
And where he once set foot, right there he stayed. 

Old 'Erb was doting, so the rumour ran, 
Ahd Rupert ran the rumour round in wheels, 
And David's harp let out heart-rending squeals: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
'Find us a harpist ! ! DAVID is the man!!' 

Dave was the man to sell the shot and shell, 
And Basil was the Greek that rode around 
On sea and land, with all convenience found 
To sell, to sell, to sell, that's it, to SELL 

Destroyers, bombs and spitting mitrailleuses. 
He used to lunch with Balfour in those days 
And if the papers seldom sang his praise, 
The simple Britons never knew he was, 

Until a narsty German told them so. 
Listen, my children, and you shall hear 
Of things that happened very long ago, 
And scarcely heed one word of what you hear. 

Bury it all, bury it all well deep, 
And let the blighters start it all over again. 
They'll trick you again and again, as you sleep; 
But you shall know that these were the men, 






Alf’s Second Bit 

THE NEO-COMMUNE 

Manhood of England, 
Dougth of the Shires, 
Want Russia to save 'em 
And answer their prayers. 
Want Russia to save 'em, 
Lenin to save 'em, Trotsky to save 'em 
(And valets to shave 'em) 
The youth of the Shires! 

Down there in Cambridge 
Between auction and plain bridge, 
Romance, revolution 1918! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
An idea between 'em 
I says! 'ave you seen 'em? 
The flower of Cambridge, 
The youth of the Shires? 




Alf’s Seventh Bit 

Did I 'ear it 'arf in a doze: 
The Co-ops was a goin' somewhere, 
Did I 'ear it while pickin' 'ops; 
How they better start takin' care, 

That the papers were gettin' together 
And the larger stores were likewise 
Considering something that would, as you 
Might say, be a surprise 

To the Co-ops, a echo or somethin'? 
They tell me that branded goods 
Don't get a discount like Mr. Selfridge 
Of 25 per cent, on their ads., and the woods 

Is where the Co-ops are goin' to, 
And that Oxford Street site 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Is not suited to co-operation 
A sort of'Arab's dream in the night. 

''We have plenty, so let it be.' 
The example of these consumers in co-operation 
Might cause thought and be therefore 
A peril to Selfridge and the nation. 




Alf’s Sixth Bit 

Let some new lying ass, 
Who knows not what is or was, 
Talk economics, 
Pay for his witless noise, 
Get the kid nice new toys, 
Call him 'professor'. 

Lies from the specialist 
Give t'old ones a newer twist 
Harder to untie. 
Here comes the hired gang 
Blood on each tired fang 
Covered with lip-stick. 

'Oh, what a charming man,' 
That's how the press blurb ran, 
'Professor K s is.' 
Now they can't fire him. 
NO! they won't hire him. 
Still Dr. S 's 
Not tied to the ring around, 
Not quite snowed under. 

Being a physicist 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
They can't quite bribe him: 
Oh, what a noise they made 
Those parliamentarians. 

Oh what a fuss they made 
Stirring the marmalade 
These parliamentarians 
Never an honest word 
In their dim halls was heard 
For more than a decade. 




Alf’s Tenth Bit 

WIND 

Scarce and thin, scarce and thin 
The government's excuse, 
Never at all will they do 
Aught of the slightest use. 
Over the dying half-wits blow, 
Over the empty-headed, and the slow 
Marchers, not getting forwarder, 
While Ramsay MacDonald sleeps, sleeps. 

Fester and rot, fester and rot, 
And angle and tergiversate 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
One thing among all things you will not 
Do, that is: think, before it's too late. 
Election will not come very soon, 
And those born with a silver spoon, 
Will keep it a little longer, 
Until the mind of the old nation gets a little stronger. 




Alf’s Third Bit 

DOLE THE BELL! BELL THE DOLE! 

Whom can these duds attack? 
Soapy Sime? Slipp'ry Mac? 
Naught but a shirt is there 
Such as the fascists wear, 
Never the man inside 
Moving a nation-wide 
Disgust with hokum. 

Plenty to right of 'em, 
Plenty to left of 'em, 
Yeh! What is left of 'em, 
Boozy, uncertain. 
See how they take it all, . 
Down there in Clerkenwall 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Readin' th' pypers! 

Syrup and soothing dope, 
Sure, they can live on hope, 
Ain't yeh got precedent ? 
Ten years and twelve years gone, 
Ten more and nothing done, 
GOD save Britannia! 




Alf’s Twelfth Bit 

BALLAD FOR THE TIMES' SPECIAL SILVER NUMBER 

Sez the Times a silver lining 
Is what has set us pining, 
Montague, Montague! 

In the season sad and weary 
When our minds are very bleary, 
Montague, Montague! 

There is Sir Hen. Deterding 
His phrases interlarding, 
Montague, Montague! 

With the this and that and what 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
For putting silver on the spot, 
Montague, Montague! 

Just drop it in the slot 
And it will surely boil the pot, 
Montague, Montague! 

Gold, of course, is solid too, 
But some silver set to stew 
Might do, too. Montague! 
With a lively wood-pulp ‘ad’. 

To cheer the bad and sad, 
Montague, Montague! 




Amities 

I 

To one, on returning certain years after 

You wore the same quite correct clothing, 
You took no pleasure at all in my triumphs, 
You had the same old air of condescension 
Mingled with a curious fear 
That I, myself, might have enjoyed them. 
Te Voilel, mon Bourrienne, you also shall be immortal. 

II 
To another 

And we say good-bye to you also, 
For you seem never to have discovered 
That your relationship is wholly parasitic; 
Yet to our feasts you bring neither 
Wit, nor good spirits, nor the pleasing attitudes 
Of discipleship. 

III 
But you, bos amic, we keep on, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
For you we owe a real debt: 
In spite of your obvious flaws, 
You once discovered a moderate chop-house. 

IV 
Iste fuit vir incultus, 
Deo Laus, quod est sepultus, 
Vermes habent eius vultum 
A-a-a-a –A-men. 
Ego autem jovialis 
Gaudero contubernalis 
Cum jocunda femina. 




An Immorality 

Sing we for love and idleness, 
Naught else is worth the having. 

Though I have been in many a land, 
There is naught else in living. 

And I would rather have my sweet, 
Though rose-leaves die of grieving, 

Than do high deeds in Hungary 
To pass all men's believing. 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

An Object 

This thing, that hath a code and not a core, 
Hath set acquaintance where might be affections, 
And nothing now 
Disturbeth his reflections. 




Ancient Music 

Winter is icummen in, 
Lhude sing Goddamm. 
Raineth drop and staineth slop, 
And how the wind doth ramm! 
Sing: Goddamm. 

Skiddeth bus and sloppeth us, 
An ague hath my ham. 
Freezeth river, turneth liver, 
Damn you, sing: Goddamm. 

Goddamm, Goddamm, 'tis why I am, Goddamm, 
So 'gainst the winter's balm. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Sing goddamm, damm, sing Goddamm. 
Sing goddamm, sing goddamm, DAMM. 




Ancient Wisdom, Rather Cosmic 

So-shu dreamed, 
And having dreamed that he was a bird, a bee, and a butterfly, 
He was uncertain why he should try to feel like anything else, 

Hence his contentment. 




Ancora 

Good God! They say you are risqué, 
O canzonetti! 
We who went out into the four A. M. of the world 
Composing our albas, 
We who shook off our dew with the rabbits, 
We who have seen even Artemis a-binding her sandals, 
Have we ever heard the like? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
O mountains of Hellas!! 
Gather about me, O Muses! 
When we sat upon the granite brink in Helicon 
Clothed in the tattered sunlight, 
Muses with delicate shins, 
O Muses with delectable knee-joints, 
When we splashed and were splashed with 
The lucid Castalian spray, 
Had we ever such an epithet cast upon us!! 




And The Days Are Not Full Enough 

And the days are not full enough 
And the nights are not full enough 
And life slips by like a field mouse 
Not shaking the grass 




And Thus In Nineveh 

Aye! I am a poet and upon my tomb 
Shall maidens scatter rose leaves 
And men myrtles, ere the night 
Slays day with her dark sword. 

'Lo ! this thing is not mine 
Nor thine to hinder, 
For the custom is full old, 
And here in Nineveh have I beheld 
Many a singer pass and take his place 
In those dim halls where no man troubleth 
His sleep or song. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And many a one hath sung his songs 
More craftily, more subtle-souled than I; 
And many a one now doth surpass 
My wave-worn beauty with his wind of flowers, 
Yet am I poet, and upon my tomb 
Shall all men scatter rose leaves 
Ere the night slay light 
With her blue sword. 

‘It is not, Raana, that my song rings highest 
Or more sweet in tone than any, but that I 
Am here a Poet, that doth drink of life 
As lesser men drink wine.’ 




Another Bit And An Offer 

I see by the morning papers 
That America's sturdy sons 
Have started a investigation 
Of the making of guns. 

The morning paper tells me 
They have asked the senate to guess 
Whether Mr. Dupont and the gun-sharks 
Have influence with the press. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

I sit alone in the twilight 
After my work is done 
And wonder if my day's three and eight-pence 
Would count on the price of a gun. 

Was I started wrong as a kiddie, 
And would my old man have been smarter 
To send me to work in Vickers 
Instead of being a carter? 




Apparuit 

Golden rose the house, in the portal I saw 
thee, a marvel, carven in subtle stuff, a 
portent. Life died down in the lamp and flickered, 
caught at the wonder. 

Crimson, frosty with dew, the roses bend where 
thou afar, moving in the glamorous sun, 
drinkst in life of earth, of the air, the tissue 
golden about thee. 

Green the ways, the breath of the fields is thine there, 
open lies the land, yet the steely going 
darkly hast thou dared and the dreaded aether 
parted before thee. 

Swift at courage thou in the shell of gold, casting 
a-loose the cloak of the body, earnest 
straight, then shone thine oriel and the stunned light 
faded about thee. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Half the graven shoulder, the throat aflash with 
strands of light inwoven about it, loveliest 
of all things, frail alabaster, ah me! 
swift in departing. 

Clothed in goldish weft, delicately perfect, 
gone as wind ! The cloth of the magical hands! 
Thou a slight thing, thou in access of cunning 
dar'dst to assume this? 




April 

Three spirits came to me 
And drew me apart 
To where the olive boughs 
Lay stripped upon the ground: 
Pale carnage beneath bright mist. 




Arides 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

The bashful Arides 
Has married an ugly wife, 
He was bored with his manner of life, 
Indifferent and discouraged he thought he might as 
Well do this as anything else. 

Saying within his heart,’I am no use to myself, 
'Let her, if she wants me, take me.' 
He went to his doom. 




Ä?ñßá (Greek Title) 

Be in me as the eternal moods 
of the bleak wind, and'not 
As transient things are 
gaiety of flowers. 
Have me in the strong loneliness 
of sunless cliffs 
And of grey waters. 
Let the gods speak softly of us 
In days hereafter, 
The shadowy flowers of Orcus 
Remember thee.

Au Jardin 

O you away high there, 
you that lean 
From amber lattices upon the cobalt night, 
I am below amid the pine trees, 
Amid the little pine trees, hear me! 

'The jester walked in the garden.' 
Did he so? 
Well, there's no use your loving me 
That way, Lady; 
For I've nothing but songs to give you. 

I am set wide upon the world's ways 
To say that life is, some way, a gay thing, 
But you never string two days upon one wire 
But there'll come sorrow of it. 
And I loved a love once, 
Over beyond the moon there, 
I loved a love once, 
And, may be, more times, 

But she danced like a pink moth in the shrubbery. 
Oh, I know you women from the 'other folk', 
And it'll all come right, 
O' Sundays. 

'The jester walked in the garden.' 
Did he so? 




Au Salon 

Her grave, sweet haughtiness 
Pleaseth me, and in like wise 
Her quiet ironies. 
Others are beautiful, none more, some less. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I suppose, when poetry comes down to facts, 
When our souls are returned to the gods 
And the spheres they belong in, 
Here in the every-day where our acts 
Rise up and judge us; 

I suppose there are a few dozen verities 
That no shift of mood can shake from us: 

One place where we'd rather have tea 
(Thus far hath modernity brought us) 
'Tea' (Damn you!) 

Have tea, damn the Caesars, 
Talk of the latest success, give wing to some scandal, 
Garble a name we detest, and for prejudice? 
Set loose the whole consummate pack 
to bay like Sir Roger de Coverley's 
This our reward for our works, 
sic crescit gloria mundi: 
Some circle of not more than three 
that we prefer to play up to, 
Some few whom we'd rather please 
than hear the whole aegrum vulgus 
Splitting its beery jowl 
a-meaowling our praises. 
Some certain peculiar things, 
cari laresque, penates, 
Some certain accustomed forms, 
the absolute unimportant. 




Ballad For Gloom 

For God, our God is a gallant foe 
That playeth behind the veil. 

I have loved my God as a child at heart 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That seeketh deep bosoms for rest, 
I have loved my God as a maid to man— 
But lo, this thing is best: 

To love your God as a gallant foe that plays behind the veil; 
To meet your God as the night winds meet beyond Arcturus' pale. 

I have played with God for a woman, 
I have staked with my God for truth, 
I have lost to my God as a man, clear-eyed— 
His dice be not of ruth. 

For I am made as a naked blade, 
But hear ye this thing in sooth: 

Who loseth to God as man to man 
Shall win at the turn of the game. 
I have drawn my blade where the lightnings meet 
But the ending is the same: 
Who loseth to God as the sword blades lose 
Shall win at the end of the game. 

For God, our God is a gallant foe that playeth behind the veil. 
Whom God deigns not to overthrow hath need of triple mail. 




Ballad Of The Goodly Fere 

Ha' we lost the goodliest fere o' all 
For the priests and the gallows tree? 
Aye lover he was of brawny men, 
O' ships and the open sea. 

When they came wi' a host to take Our Man 
His smile was good to see, 
"First let these go!" quo' our Goodly Fere, 
"Or I'll see ye damned," says he. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Aye he sent us out through the crossed high spears 
And the scorn of his laugh rang free, 
"Why took ye not me when I walked about 
Alone in the town?" says he. 

Oh we drank his "Hale" in the good red wine 
When we last made company, 
No capon priest was the Goodly Fere 
But a man o' men was he. 

I ha' seen him drive a hundred men 
Wi' a bundle o' cords swung free, 
That they took the high and holy house 
For their pawn and treasury. 

They'll no' get him a' in a book I think 
Though they write it cunningly; 
No mouse of the scrolls was the Goodly Fere 
But aye loved the open sea. 

If they think they ha' snared our Goodly Fere 
They are fools to the last degree. 
"I'll go to the feast," quo' our Goodly Fere, 
"Though I go to the gallows tree." 

"Ye ha' seen me heal the lame and blind, 
And wake the dead," says he, 
"Ye shall see one thing to master all: 
'Tis how a brave man dies on the tree." 



A son of God was the Goodly Fere 
That bade us his brothers be. 
I ha' seen him cow a thousand men. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I have seen him upon the tree. 

He cried no cry when they drave the nails 
And the blood gushed hot and free, 
The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue 
But never a cry cried he. 

I ha' seen him cow a thousand men 
On the hills o' Galilee, 
They whined as he walked out calm between, 
Wi' his eyes like the grey o' the sea, 

Like the sea that brooks no voyaging 
With the winds unleashed and free, 
Like the sea that he cowed at Genseret 
Wi' twey words spoke' suddently. 

A master of men was the Goodly Fere, 
A mate of the wind and sea, 
If they think they ha' slain our Goodly Fere 
They are fools eternally. 

I ha' seen him eat o' the honey-comb 
Sin' they nailed him to the tree. 




Ballatetta 

The light became her grace and dwelt among 
Blind eyes and shadows that are formed as men; 
Lo, how the light doth melt us into song: 

The broken sunlight for a healm she beareth 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Who hath my heart in jurisdiction. 
In wild-wood never fawn nor fallow fareth 
So silent light; no gossamer is spun 
So delicate as she is, when the sun 
Drives the clear emeralds from the bended grasses 
Lest they should parch too swiftly, where she passes. 




Before Sleep 

The lateral vibrations caress me, 
They leap and caress me, 
They work pathetically in my favour, 
They seek my financial good. 

She of the spear stands present. 
The gods of the underworld attend me, O Annubis, 
These are they of thy company. 
With a pathetic solicitude they attend me; 
Undulant, 
Their realm is the lateral courses. 

Light! 
I am up to follow thee, Pallas. 
Up and out of their caresses. 
You were gone up as a rocket, 
Bending your passages from right to left and from left to right 
In the flat projection of a spiral. 
The gods of drugged sleep attend me, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Wishing me well; 
I am up to follow thee, Pallas. 




Black Slippers: Bellotti 

At the table beyond us 
With her little suede slippers off, 
With her white-stocking'd feet 
Carefully kept from the floor by a napkin, 
She converses: 

'Connaissez-vous Ostende?' 

The gurgling Italian lady on the other side of the 
restaurant 
Replies with a certain hauteur, 
But I await with patience, 
To see how Celestine will re-enter her slippers. 
She re-enters them with a groan. 




Brennbaum 

The sky-like limpid eyes, 
The circular infant's face, 
The stiffness from spats to collar 
Never relaxing into grace; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

The heavy memories of Horeb, Sinai and the forty years, 
Showed only when the daylight fell 
Level across the face 
Of Brennbaum 'The Impeccable'. 




Cantico Del Sole 

The thought of what America would be like 
If the Classics had a wide circulation 
 Troubles my sleep, 
The thought of what America, 
The thought of what America,The thought of what America would be like 
If the Classics had a wide circulation 
Troubles my sleep. 
Nunc dimittis, now lettest thou thy servant,

 Depart in peace. 
The thought of what America,

The thought of what America would be like 
If the Classics had a wide circulation... 
 Oh well!

Canto 13 

Kung walked 
by the dynastic temple 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and into the cedar grove, 
and then out by the lower river, 
And with him Khieu Tchi

 and Tian the low speaking 
And "we are unknown," said Kung, 
"You will take up charioteering?

 "Then you will become known, 
"Or perhaps I should take up charioterring, or archery? 
"Or the practice of public speaking?" 
And Tseu-lou said, "I would put the defences in order," 
And Khieu said, "If I were lord of a province 
"I would put it in better order than this is." 
And Tchi said, "I would prefer a small mountain temple, 
"With order in the observances,

 with a suitable performance of the ritual," 
And Tian said, with his hand on the strings of his lute 
The low sounds continuing

 after his hand left the strings, 
And the sound went up like smoke, under the leaves, 
And he looked after the sound:

 "The old swimming hole, 
"And the boys flopping off the planks, 
"Or sitting in the underbrush playing mandolins."

 And Kung smiled upon all of them equally. 
And Thseng-sie desired to know:

 "Which had answered correctly?" 
And Kung said, "They have all answered correctly, 
"That is to say, each in his nature." 
And Kung raised his cane against Yuan Jang,

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 Yuan Jang being his elder, 
For Yuan Jang sat by the roadside pretending to 
be receiving wisdom. 
And Kung said 
"You old fool, come out of it, 
"Get up and do something useful." 
And Kung said 
"Respect a child's faculties 



"From the moment it inhales the clear air, 
"But a man of fifty who knows nothng

 Is worthy of no respect." 
And "When the prince has gathered about him 
"All the savants and artists, his riches will be fully employed." 
And Kung said, and wrote on the bo leaves:

 If a man have not order within him 
He can not spread order about him; 
And if a man have not order within him 
His family will not act with due order;

 And if the prince have not order within him 
He can not put order in his dominions. 
And Kung gave the words "order" 
and "brotherly deference" 
And said nothing of the "life after death." 
And he said

 "Anyone can run to excesses, 
"It is easy to shoot past the mark, 
"It is hard to stand firm in the middle." 

And they said: If a man commit murder 
Should his father protect him, and hide him? 
And Kung said: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
He should hide him. 

And Kung gave his daughter to Kong-Tchang 
Although Kong-Tchang was in prison. 
And he gave his niece to Nan-Young 
although Nan-Young was out of office. 
And Kung said "Wan ruled with moderation,

 "In his day the State was well kept, 
"And even I can remember 
"A day when the historians left blanks in their writings, 
"I mean, for things they didn't know, 
"But that time seems to be passing. 
A day when the historians left blanks in their writings, 
But that time seems to be passing." 
And Kung said, "Without character you will

 "be unable to play on that instrument 
"Or to execute the music fit for the Odes. 
"The blossoms of the apricot

 "blow from the east to the west, 



"And I have tried to keep them from falling." 



Canto 49 

For the seven lakes, and by no man these verses: 
Rain; empty river; a voyage, 
Fire from frozen cloud, heavy rain in the twilight 
Under the cabin roof was one lantern. 
The reeds are heavy; bent; 
and the bamboos speak as if weeping. 

Autumn moon; hills rise about lakes 
against sunset 
Evening is like a curtain of cloud, 
a blurr above ripples; and through it 
sharp long spikes of the cinnamon, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
a cold tune amid reeds. 
Behind hill the monk's bell 
borne on the wind. 
Sail passed here in April; may return in October 
Boat fades in silver; slowly; 
Sun blaze alone on the river. 

Where wine flag catches the sunset 
Sparse chimneys smoke in the cross light 

Comes then snow scur on the river 
And a world is covered with jade 
Small boat floats like a lanthorn, 
The flowing water closts as with cold. And at San Yin 
they are a people of leisure. 

Wild geese swoop to the sand-bar, 
Clouds gather about the hole of the window 
Broad water; geese line out with the autumn 
Rooks clatter over the fishermen's lanthorns, 

A light moves on the north sky line; 
where the young boys prod stones for shrimp. 
In seventeen hundred came Tsing to these hill lakes. 
A light moves on the South sky line. 

State by creating riches shd. thereby get into debt? 



Thsi is infamy; this is Geryon.

Canto I 

And then went down to the ship, 
Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and 
We set up mast and sail on that swart ship, 
Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also 
Heavy with weeping, and winds from sternward 
Bore us onward with bellying canvas, 
Crice's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess. 
Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller, 
Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea till day's end. 
Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean, 
Came we then to the bounds of deepest water, 
To the Kimmerian lands, and peopled cities 
Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever 
With glitter of sun-rays 
Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven 
Swartest night stretched over wreteched men there. 
The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place 
Aforesaid by Circe. 
Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus, 
And drawing sword from my hip 
I dug the ell-square pitkin; 
Poured we libations unto each the dead, 
First mead and then sweet wine, water mixed with white flour 
Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads; 
As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods, 
A sheep to Tiresias only, black and a bell-sheep. 
Dark blood flowed in the fosse, 
Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead, of brides 
Of youths and of the old who had borne much; 
Souls stained with recent tears, girls tender, 
Men many, mauled with bronze lance heads, 
Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms, 
These many crowded about me; with shouting, 
Pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts; 
Slaughtered the herds, sheep slain of bronze; 
Poured ointment, cried to the gods, 
To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine; 
Unsheathed the narrow sword, 



I sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead, 
Till I should hear Tiresias. 
But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor, 
Unburied, cast on the wide earth, 
Limbs that we left in the house of Circe, 
Unwept, unwrapped in the sepulchre, since toils urged other. 
Pitiful spirit. And I cried in hurried speech: 
'Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast? 
'Cam'st thou afoot, outstripping seamen? '

 And he in heavy speech: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
'Ill fate and abundant wine. I slept in Crice's ingle. 
'Going down the long ladder unguarded, 
'I fell against the buttress, 
'Shattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought Avernus. 
'But thou, O King, I bid remember me, unwept, unburied, 
'Heap up mine arms, be tomb by sea-bord, and inscribed: 
'A man of no fortune, and with a name to come. 
'And set my oar up, that I swung mid fellows.' 

And Anticlea came, whom I beat off, and then Tiresias Theban, 
Holding his golden wand, knew me, and spoke first: 
'A second time? why? man of ill star, 
'Facing the sunless dead and this joyless region? 
'Stand from the fosse, leave me my bloody bever 
'For soothsay.'

 And I stepped back, 
And he strong with the blood, said then: 'Odysseus 
'Shalt return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas, 
'Lose all companions.' Then Anticlea came. 
Lie quiet Divus. I mean, that is Andreas Divus, 
In officina Wecheli, 1538, out of Homer. 
And he sailed, by Sirens and thence outwards and away 
And unto Crice.

 Venerandam, 
In the Cretan's phrase, with the golden crown, Aphrodite, 
Cypri munimenta sortita est, mirthful, oricalchi, with golden 
Girdle and breat bands, thou with dark eyelids

Bearing the golden bough of Argicidia. So that: 




Canto Iii 

Another's a half-cracked fellow—John Heydon, 
Worker of miracles, dealer in levitation, 
In thoughts upon pure form, in alchemy, 
Seer of pretty visions ('servant of God and secretary of nature'); 
Full of plaintive charm, like Botticelli's, 
With half-transparent forms, lacking the vigor of gods. 
Thus Heydon, in a trance, at Bulverton, 
Had such a sight: 
Decked all in green, with sleeves of yellow silk 
Slit to the elbow, slashed with various purples. 
Her eyes were green as glass, her foot was leaf-like. 
She was adorned with choicest emeralds, 
And promised him the way of holy wisdom. 
'Pretty green bank,' began the half-lost poem. 
Take the old way, say I met John Heydon, 
Sought out the place, 
Lay on the bank, was 'plungèd deep in swevyn;' 
And saw the company—Layamon, Chaucer— 
Pass each in his appropriate robes; 
Conversed with each, observed the varying fashion. 
And then comes Heydon. 
'I have seen John Heydon.' 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Let us hear John Heydon! 
'Omniformis 
Omnis intellectus est'—thus he begins, by spouting half of Psellus. 
(Then comes a note, my assiduous commentator: 
Not Psellus De Daemonibus, but Porphyry's Chances, 
In the thirteenth chapter, that 'every intellect is omni-form.') 
Magnifico Lorenzo used the dodge, 
Says that he met Ficino 
In some Wordsworthian, false-pastoral manner, 
And that they walked along, stopped at a well-head, 
And heard deep platitudes about contentment 
From some old codger with an endless beard. 
'A daemon is not a particular intellect, 
But is a substance differed from intellect,' 
Breaks in Ficino, 
'Placed in the latitude or locus of souls'— 
That's out of Proclus, take your pick of them. 



Valla, more earth and sounder rhetoric— 
Prefacing praise to his Pope Nicholas: 
'A man of parts, skilled in the subtlest sciences; 
A patron of the arts, of poetry; and of a fine discernment.' 
Then comes a catalogue, his jewels of conversation. 
No, you've not read your Elegantiae— 
A dull book?—shook the church. 
The prefaces, cut clear and hard: 
'Know then the Roman speech, a sacrament,' 
Spread for the nations, eucharist of wisdom, 
Bread of the liberal arts. 
Ha! Sir Blancatz, 
Sordello would have your heart to give to all the princes; 
Valla, the heart of Rome, 
Sustaining speech, set out before the people. 
'Nec bonus Christianus ac bonus 
Tullianus.' 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Marius, Du Bellay, wept for the buildings, 
Baldassar Castiglione saw Raphael 
'Lead back the soul into its dead, waste dwelling,' 
Corpore laniato; and Lorenzo Valla, 
'Broken in middle life? bent to submission?— 
Took a fat living from the Papacy' 
(That's in Villari, but Burckhardt's statement is different)— 
'More than the Roman city, the Roman speech' 
(Holds fast its part among the ever-living). 
'Not by the eagles only was Rome measured.' 
'Wherever the Roman speech was, there was Rome,' 
Wherever the speech crept, there was mastery 
Spoke with the law's voice while your Greek, logicians... 
More Greeks than one! Doughty's 'divine Homeros' 
Came before sophistry. Justinopolitan 
Uncatalogued Andreas Divus, 
Gave him in Latin, 1538 in my edition, the rest uncertain, 
Caught up his cadence, word and syllable: 
'Down to the ships we went, set mast and sail, 
Black keel and beasts for bloody sacrifice, 
Weeping we went.' 
I've strained my ear for -ensa, -ombra, and -ensa 
And cracked my wit on delicate canzoni— 
Here's but rough meaning: 
'And then went down to the ship, set keel to breakers, 



Forth on the godly sea; 
We set up mast and sail on the swarthy ship, 
Sheep bore we aboard her, and our bodies also 
Heavy with weeping. And winds from sternward 
Bore us out onward with bellying canvas— 
Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess. 
Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller. 
Thus with stretched sail 
We went over sea till day's end: 
Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Came we then to the bounds of deepest water, 
To the Kimmerian lands and peopled cities 
Covered with close-webbed mist, unpiercèd ever 
With glitter of sun-rays, 
Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven, 
Swartest night stretched over wretched men there. 
Thither we in that ship, unladed sheep there, 
The ocean flowing backward, came we through to the place 
Aforesaid by Circe. 
Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus, 
And drawing sword from my hip 
I dug the ell-square pitkin, poured we libations unto each the dead, 
First mead and then sweet wine, 
Water mixed with white flour. 
Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads 
As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best, 
For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods. 
Sheep, to Tiresias only, 
Black, and a bell sheep; 
Dark blood flowed in the fosse. 
Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead 
Of brides, of youths, and of many passing old, 
Virgins tender, souls stained with recent tears, 
Many men mauled with bronze lance-heads, 
Battle spoil, bearing yet dreary arms: 
These many crowded about me, 
With shouting, pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Slaughtered the herds—sheep slain of bronze, 
Poured ointment, cried to the gods, 
To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine. 
Unsheathed the narrow steel, 
I sat to keep off the impetuous, impotent dead 



Till I should hear Tiresias. 
But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor, 
Unburied, cast on the wide earth— 
Limbs that we left in the house of Circe, 
Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other, 
Pitiful spirit—and I cried in hurried speech: 
'Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?

Heap up mine arms, be tomb by the sea-board, and inscribed, 
A man of no fortune and with a name to come; 
And set my oar up, that I swung 'mid fellows.' 
Came then another ghost, whom I beat off, Anticlea, 
And then Tiresias, Theban, 
Holding his golden wand, knew me and spoke first: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
'Man of ill hour, why come a second time, 
Leaving the sunlight, facing the sunless dead and this joyless region? 
Stand from the fosse, move back, leave me my bloody bever, 
And I will speak you true speeches.' 
'And I stepped back, 
Sheathing the yellow sword. Dark blood he drank then 
And spoke: 'Lustrous Odysseus, shalt 
Return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas, 
Lose all companions.' Foretold me the ways and the signs. 
Came then Anticlea, to whom I answered: 
'Fate drives me on through these deeps; I sought Tiresias.' 
I told her news of Troy, and thrice her shadow 
Faded in my embrace. 
Then had I news of many faded women— 
Tyro, Alcmena, Chloris— 
Heard out their tales by that dark fosse, and sailed 
By sirens and thence outward and away, 
And unto Circe buried Elpenor's corpse.' 

Lie quiet, Divus. 
In Officina Wechli, Paris, 

M. D. three X's, Eight, with Aldus on the Frogs, 
And a certain Cretan's 


Hymni Deorum:

Sail passed here in April; may return in October 
Boat fades in silver; slowly;

Sparse chimneys smoke in the cross light 

Comes then snow scur on the river 
And a world is covered with jade

Canto Xlv 

With Usura 

With usura hath no man a house of good stone 
each block cut smooth and well fitting 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
that design might cover their face, 
with usura 
hath no man a painted paradise on his church wall 
harpes et luz 
or where virgin receiveth message 
and halo projects from incision, 
with usura 
seeth no man Gonzaga his heirs and his concubines 
no picture is made to endure nor to live with 
but it is made to sell and sell quickly 
with usura, sin against nature, 
is thy bread ever more of stale rags 
is thy bread dry as paper, 
with no mountain wheat, no strong flour 
with usura the line grows thick 
with usura is no clear demarcation 
and no man can find site for his dwelling. 
Stonecutter is kept from his tone 
weaver is kept from his loom 

WITH USURA 
wool comes not to market 
sheep bringeth no gain with usura 
Usura is a murrain, usura 
blunteth the needle in the maid's hand 
and stoppeth the spinner's cunning. Pietro Lombardo 
came not by usura 
Duccio came not by usura 
nor Pier della Francesca; Zuan Bellin' not by usura 
nor was ‘La Calunnia' painted. 
Came not by usura Angelico; came not Ambrogio Praedis, 
Came no church of cut stone signed: Adamo me fecit. 
Not by usura St. Trophime 
Not by usura Saint Hilaire, 
Usura rusteth the chisel 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
It rusteth the craft and the craftsman 
It gnaweth the thread in the loom 
None learneth to weave gold in her pattern; 
Azure hath a canker by usura; cramoisi is unbroidered 
Emerald findeth no Memling 
Usura slayeth the child in the womb 
It stayeth the young man's courting 
It hath brought palsey to bed, lyeth 
between the young bride and her bridegroom 

CONTRA NATURAM 
They have brought whores for Eleusis 
Corpses are set to banquet 
at behest of usura. 

N.B. Usury: A charge for the use of purchasing power, levied without regard to 
production; often without regard to the possibilities of production. (Hence the 
failure of the Medici bank.) 



Canto XVI 

And before hell mouth; dry plain 
and two mountains; 
On the one mountain, a running form,

 and another 
In the turn of the hill; in hard steel 
The road like a slow screw's thread, 
The angle almost imperceptible,

 so that the circuit seemed hardly to rise; 
And the running form, naked, Blake, 
Shouting, whirling his arms, the swift limbs, 
Howling against the evil,

 his eyes rolling, 
Whirling like flaming cart-wheels, 
and his head held backward to gaze on the evil 
As he ran from it, 
to be hid by the steel mountain, 
And when he showed again from the north side; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
his eyes blazing toward hell mouth, 
His neck forward,

 and like him Peire Cardinal. 
And in the west mountain, Il Fiorentino, 
Seeing hell in his mirror,

 and lo Sordels 
Looking on it in his shield; 
And Augustine, gazing toward the invisible. 

And past them, the criminal 
lying in the blue lakes of acid, 
The road between the two hills, upward

 slowly, 
The flames patterned in lacquer, crimen est actio, 
The limbo of chopped ice and saw-dust, 
And I bathed myself with acid to free myself

 of the hell ticks, 
Scales, fallen louse eggs.

 Palux Laerna, 
the lake of bodies, aqua morta, 
of limbs fluid, and mingled, like fish heaped in a bin, 
and here an arm upward, clutching a fragment of marble, 



And the embryos, in flux, 
new inflow, submerging, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Here an arm upward, trout, submerged by the eels;

 and from the bank, the stiff herbage 
the dry nobbled path, saw many known, and unknown, 
for an instant;

 submerging, 
The face gone, generation.

 Then light, air, under saplings, 
the blue banded lake under æther, 
an oasis, the stones, the calm field, 
the grass quiet, 
and passing the tree of the bough 
The grey stone posts, 
and the stair of gray stone, 
the passage clean-squared in granite: 
descending, 
and I through this, and into the earth, 
patet terra, 
entered the quiet air 
the new sky, 
the light as after a sun-set, 
and by their fountains, the heroes, 
Sigismundo, and Malatesta Novello, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and founders, gazing at the mounts of their cities. 

The plain, distance, and in fount-pools 
the nymphs of that water 
rising, spreading their garlands, 
weaving their water reeds with the boughs, 
In the quiet, 
and now one man rose from his fountain 
and went off into the plain. 

Prone in that grass, in sleep; 
et j'entendis des voix:…

 wall . . . Strasbourg 
Galliffet led that triple charge. . . Prussians 
and he said [Plarr's narration]

 it was for the honour of the army. 
And they called him a swashbuckler. 



 I didn't know what it was 
But I thought: This is pretty bloody damn fine. 
And my old nurse, he was a man nurse, and 
He killed a Prussian and he lay in the street 
there in front of our house for three days 
And he stank. . . . . . .

 Brother Percy, 
And our Brother Percy…

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 old Admiral 
He was a middy in those days, 
And they came into Ragusa 
. . . . . . place those men went for the Silk War. . . . . 
And they saw a procession coming down through 
A cut in the hills, carrying something 
The six chaps in front carrying a long thing

 on their shoulders, 
And they thought it was a funeral, 
but the thing was wrapped up in scarlet, 
And he put off in the cutter,

 he was a middy in those days, 
To see what the natives were doing, 
And they got up to the six fellows in livery, 
And they looked at it, and I can still hear the old admiral, 
"Was it? it was

 Lord Byron 
Dead drunk, with the face of an A y n. . . . . . . . 
He pulled it out long, like that:

 the face of an a y n . . . . . . . . gel." 

And because that son of a bitch,

 Franz Josef of Austria. . . . . . 
And because that son of a bitch Napoléon Barbiche… 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
They put Aldington on Hill 70, in a trench

 dug through corpses 
With a lot of kids of sixteen, 
Howling and crying for their mamas, 
And he sent a chit back to his major:

 I can hold out for ten minutes 
With my sergeant and a machine-gun. 
And they rebuked him for levity. 
And Henri Gaudier went to it, 
and they killed him, 



And killed a good deal of sculpture, 
And ole T.E.H. he went to it, 
With a lot of books from the library, 
London Library, and a shell buried ‘em in a dug-out, 
And the Library expressed its annoyance.

 And a bullet hit him on the elbow 
…gone through the fellow in front of him, 
And he read Kant in the Hospital, in Wimbledon, 
in the original, 
And the hospital staff didn't like it. 

And Wyndham Lewis went to it, 
With a heavy bit of artillery, 
and the airmen came by with a mitrailleuse, 
And cleaned out most of his company, 
and a shell lit on his tin hut, 
While he was out in the privy, 
and he was all there was left of that outfit. 

Windeler went to it, 
and he was out in the Ægæan, 
And down in the hold of his ship 
pumping gas into a sausage, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

And the boatswain looked over the rail, 
down into amidships, and he said: 
Gees! look a' the Kept'n, 

The Kept'n's a-gettin' ‘er up. 

And Ole Captain Baker went to it, 
with his legs full of rheumatics, 
So much so he couldn't run, 
so he was six months in hospital, 
Observing the mentality of the patients. 

And Fletcher was 19 when he went to it, 
And his major went mad in the control pit, 
about midnight, and started throwing the ‘phone about 
And he had to keep him quiet 
till abut six in the morning, 
And direct that bunch of artillery. 

And Ernie Hemingway went to it, 



 too much in a hurry, 
And they buried him for four days. 

Et ma foi, vous savez,

 tous les nerveux. Non, 
Y a une limite; les bêtes, les bêtes ne sont 
Pas faites pour ça, c'est peu de chose un cheval.

 qui criaient "maman." Mais les costauds, 
La fin, là à Verdun, n'y avait que ces gros bonshommes

 Et y voyaient extrêmement clair.

Y sortaient fouiller un cadavre, pour rien,

Et les boches, tout ce que vous voulez,

Mais ces pauvres types 
A la fin y s'attaquaient pour manger,

 Sans orders, les bêtes sauvages, on y fait 
Prisonniers; ceux qui parlaient français disaient: 
"Poo quah? Ma foi on attaquait pour manger." 

C'est le corr-ggras, le corps gras,

 leurs trains marchaient trois kilomètres à l'heure, 
Et ça criait, ça grincait, on l'entendait à cinq kilomètres. 
(Ça qui finit la guerre.)

 Liste officielle des morts 5,000,000. 

I vous dit, bè, voui, tout sentait le pétrole. 
Mais, Non! je l'ai engueulé. 
Je lui ai dit: T'es un con! T'a raté la guerre. 



O voui! tous les homes de goût, y conviens,

Il était dans une fabrique. 
What, burying squad, terrassiers, avec leur tête

 en arrière, qui regardaient comme ça, 
On risquait la vie pour un coup de pelle, 
Faut que ça soit bein carré, exact… 

Dey vus a bolcheviki dere, und dey dease him: 
Looka vat youah Trotzsk is done, e iss

"Dey say, "Vot?" Un de posch say:

That's the trick with a crowd,

 Get ‘em into the street and get ‘em moving. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And all the time, there were people going 
Down there, over the river.

 There was a man there talking, 
To a thousand, just a short speech, and 
Then move ‘em on. And he said: 
Yes, these people, they are all right, they 
Can do everything, everything except act; 
And go an' hear ‘em but when they are through 
Come to the bolsheviki… 

And when it broke, there was the crowd there, 
And the cossacks, just as always before, 



But one thing, the cossacks said:

 "Pojalouista." 
And that got round in the crowd, 
And then a lieutenant of infantry 
Ordered ‘em to fire into the crowd,

 in the square at the end of the Nevsky, 
In front of the Moscow station, 
And they wouldn't, 
And he pulled his sword on a student for laughing, 
And killed him, 
And a cossack rode out of his squad 
On the other side of the square 
And cut down the lieutenant of infantry 
And there was the revolution…

 as soon as they named it. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And you can't make ‘em, 
Nobody knew it was coming. They were all ready, the old gang, 
Guns on the top of the post-office and the palace, 
But none of the leaders knew it was coming. 

And there were some killed at the barracks, 
But that was between the troops. 

So we used to hear it at the opera 
That they wouldn't be under Haig; 
and that the advance was beginning; 
That it was going to begin in a week. 




Canto XXXVI 

A Lady asks me

 I speak in season 
She seeks reason for an affect, wild often 
That is so proud he hath Love for a name 
Who denys it can hear the truth now 
Wherefore I speak to the present knowers 
Having no hope that low-hearted

 Can bring sight to such reason 
Be there not natural demonstration

 I have no will to try proof-bringing 
Or say where it hath birth 
What is its virtu and power 
Its being and every moving 
Or delight whereby ‘tis called "to love" 
Or if man can show it to sight. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Where memory liveth,

 it takes its state 
Formed like a diafan from light on shade 
Which shadow cometh of Mars and remaineth 
Created, having a name sensate, 
Custom of the soul,

 will from the heart; 
Cometh from a seen form which being understood 
Taketh locus and remaining in the intellect possible 
Wherein hath he neither weight nor still-standing, 
Descendeth not by quality but shineth out 
Himself his own effect unendingly 
Not in delight but in the being aware 
Nor can he leave his true likeness otherwhere. 

He is not vertu but cometh of that perfection 
Which is so postulate not by the reason 
But ‘tis felt, I say. 
Beyond salvation, holdeth his judging force 
Deeming intention to be reason's peer and mate, 
Poor in discernment, being thus weakness' friend 
Often his power cometh on death in the end, 
Be it withstayed 



 and so swinging counterweight. 
Not that it were natural opposite, but only 
Wry'd a bit from the perfect, 
Let no man say love cometh from chance 
Or hath not established lordship 
Holding his power even though

 Memory hath him no more. 

Cometh he to be

 when the will 
From overplus 
Twisteth out of natural measure, 
Never adorned with rest Moveth he changing colour 
Either to laugh or weep 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Contorting the face with fear

 resteth but a little 
Yet shall ye see of him That he is most often 
With folk who deserve him 
And his strange quality sets sighs to move 
Willing man look into that forméd trace in his mind 
And with such uneasiness as rouseth the flame. 
Unskilled can not form his image, 
He himself moveth not, drawing all to his stillness, 
Neither turneth about to seek his delight 
Nor yet to see out proving 
Be it so great or so small. 

He draweth likeness and hue from like nature 
So making pleasure more certain in seeming 
Nor can stand hid in such nearness, 
Beautys be darts tho' not savage 
Skilled from such fear a man follows 
Deserving spirit, that pierceth. 
Nor is he known from his face 
But taken in the white light that is allness 
Toucheth his aim 
Who heareth, seeth not form 
But is led by its emanation 
Being divided, set out from colour, 
Disjunct in mid darkness 
Grazeth the light, one moving by other, 
Being divided, divided from all falsity 



<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Worthy of trust 
From him alone mercy proceedeth. 

Go, song, surely thou mayest 
Whither it please thee 
For so art thou ornate that thy reasons 
Shall be praised from thy understanders, 
With others hast thou no will to make company. 

"Called thrones, balascio or topaze" 
Eriugina was not understood in his time 
"which explains, perhaps, the delay in condemning him" 
And they went looking for Manicheans

So they dug for, and damned Scotus Eriugina

 never the other way on"

Cino 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Italian Campagna 1309, the open road 

Bah! I have sung women in three cities, 
But it is all the same; 
And I will sing of the sun. 

Lips, words, and you snare them, 
Dreams, words, and they are as jewels, 
Strange spells of old deity, 
Ravens, nights, allurement: 
And they are not; 
Having become the souls of song. 

Eyes, dreams, lips, and the night goes. 
Being upon the road once more, 
They are not. 
Forgetful in their towers of our tuneing 
Once for wind-runeing 
They dream us-toward and 
Sighing, say, ``Would Cino, 
Passionate Cino, of the wrinkling eyes, 
Gay Cino, of quick laughter, 
Cino, of the dare, the jibe. 
Frail Cino, strongest of his tribe 
That tramp old ways beneath the sun-light, 
Would Cino of the Luth were here!'' 

Once, twice a year--Vaguely 
thus word they: 

``Cino?'' ``Oh, eh, Cino Polnesi 
The singer is't you mean?'' 
``Ah yes, passed once our way, 
A saucy fellow, but . . . 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
(Oh they are all one these vagabonds), 
Peste! 'tis his own songs? 
Or some other's that he sings? 
But *you*, My Lord, how with your city?'' 



My you ``My Lord,'' God's pity! 
And all I knew were out, My Lord, you 
Were Lack-land Cino, e'en as I am, 
O Sinistro. 

I have sung women in three cities. 
But it is all one. 
I will sing of the sun. 
. . . eh? . . . they mostly had grey eyes, 
But it is all one, I will sing of the sun. 

``'Pollo Phoibee, old tin pan, you 
Glory to Zeus' aegis-day, 
Shield o' steel-blue, th' heaven o'er us 
Hath for boss thy lustre gay! 

'Pollo Phoibee, to our way-fare 
Make thy laugh our wander-lied; 
Bid thy 'flugence bear away care. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Cloud and rain-tears pass they fleet! 

Seeking e'er the new-laid rast-way 
To the gardens of the sun . . . 

* * * 

I have sung women in three cities 
But it is all one. 
I will sing of the white birds 
In the blue waters of heaven, 
The clouds that are spray to its sea." 




Coda 

O My songs, 
Why do you look so eagerly and so curiously into 
people's faces, 
Will you find your lost dead among them? 




Coitus 

The gilded phaloi of the crocuses 
are thrusting at the spring air. 
Here is there naught of dead gods 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But a procession of festival, 
A procession, Giulio Romano, 
Fit for your spirit to dwell in. 
Dione, your nights are upon us. 

The dew is upon the leaf. 
The night about us is restless. 




Come To My Cantilations 

Come my cantilations, 
Let us dump our hatreds into one bunch and be done with them, 
Hot sun, clear water, fresh wind, 
Let me be free of pavements, 
Let me be free of the printers. 
Let come beautiful people 
Wearing raw silk of good colour, 
Let come the graceful speakers, 
Let come the ready of wit, 
Let come the gay of manner, the insolent and the exulting. 
We speak of burnished lakes, 
Of dry air, as clear as metal. 




Commission 

Go, my songs, to the lonely and the unsatisfied, 
Go also to the nerve-racked, go to the enslaved-by-convention, 
Bear to them my contempt for their oppressors. 
Go as a great wave of cool water, 
Bear my contempt of oppressors. 

Speak against unconscious oppression, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Speak against the tyranny of the unimaginative, 
Speak against bonds. 
Go to the bourgeoise who is dying of her ennuis, 
Go to the women in suburbs. 
Go to the hideously wedded, 
Go to them whose failure is concealed, 
Go to the unluckily mated, 
Go to the bought wife, 
Go to the woman entailed. 

Go to those who have delicate lust, 
Go to those whose delicate desires are thwarted, 
Go like a blight upon the dulness of the world; 
Go with your edge against this, 
Strengthen the subtle cords, 
Bring confidence upon the algae and the tentacles of the soul. 
Go in a friendly manner, 
Go with an open speech. 
Be eager to find new evils and new good, 
Be against all forms of oppression. 
Go to those who are thickened with middle age, 
To those who have lost their interest. 

Go to the adolescent who are smothered in family-
Oh how hideous it is 
To see three generations of one house gathered together! 
It is like an old tree with shoots, 
And with some branches rotted and falling. 

Go out and defy opinion, 
Go against this vegetable bondage of the blood. 
Be against all sorts of mortmain.

Dance Figure 

For the Marriage in Cana of Galilee 

Dark-eyed, 
O woman of my dreams, 
Ivory sandalled, 
There is none like thee among the dancers, 
None with swift feet. 
I have not found thee in the tents, 
In the broken darkness. 
I have not found thee at the well-head 
Among the women with pitchers. 
Thine arms are as a young sapling under the bark; 
Thy face as a river with lights. 

White as an almond are thy shoulders; 
As new almonds stripped from the husk. 
They guard thee not with eunuchs; 
Not with bars of copper. 

Gilt turquoise and silver are in the place of thy rest. 
A brown robe, with threads of gold woven in 
patterns, hast thou gathered about thee, 
O Nathat-Ikanaie, 'Tree-at-the-river'. 

As a rillet among the sedge are thy hands upon me; 
Thy fingers a frosted stream. 

Thy maidens are white like pebbles; 
Their music about thee! 

There is none like thee among the dancers; 
None with swift feet.

Dans Un Omnibus De Londres 

Les yeux d'une morte 
M'ont salué, 
Enchassés dans un visage stupide 
Dont tous les autres traits étaient banals, 
Ils m'ont salué 
Et alors je vis bien des choses 
Au dedans de ma mémoire 
Remuer, 
S'éveiller. 

Je vis des canards sur le bord d'un lac minuscule, 
Auprè 
s d'un petit enfant gai, bossu. 
Je vis les colonnes anciennes en ctoc' 
Du Pare Monceau, 
Et deux petites filles graciles, 
Des patriciennes, 
aux toisons couleur de lin, 
Et des pigeonnes 
Grasses 
comme des poulardes. 
Je vis le pare, 
Et tous les gazons divers 
Ou nous avions loué des chaises 
Pour quatre sous. 

Je vis les cygnes noirs, 
Japonais, 
Leurs ailes 
Teinté 
es de couleur sang-de-dragon, 
Et toutes les fleurs 
D'Armenonville. 
Les yeux d'une morte 
M'ont salué.

I even I, am he who knoweth the roads 
Through the sky, and the wind thereof is my body. 

I have beheld the Lady of Life, 
I, even I, who fly with the swallows. 

Green and gray is her raiment, 
Trailing along the wind. 

I, even I, am he who knoweth the roads 
Through the sky, and the wind thereof is my body. 

Manus animam pinxit, 
My pen is in my hand 

To write the acceptable word. . . . 
My mouth to chant the pure singing! 

Who hath the mouth to receive it, 
The song of the Lotus of Kumi? 

I, even I, am he who knoweth the roads 
Through the sky, and the wind thereof is my body. 

I am flame that riseth in the sun, 
I, even I, who fly with the swallows. 

The moon is upon my forehead, 
The winds are under my lips. 

The moon is a great pearl in the waters of sapphire, 
Cool to my fingers the flowing waters. 

I, even I, am he who knoweth the roads 
Through the sky, and the wind thereof is my body.

FROM CHARLES D'ORLEANS 
God! that mad'st her well regard her,

How she is so fair and bonny; 
For the great charms that are upon her 
Ready are all folks to reward her. 

Who could part him from her borders 
When spells are alway renewed on her? 
God! that mad'st her well regard her, 
How she is so fair and bonny. 

From here to there to the sea's border, 
Dame nor damsel there's not any 
Hath of perfect charms so many. 
Thoughts of her are of dream's order: 
God! that mad'st her well regard her. 




Dompna Pois De Me No'Us Cal 

FROM THE PROVENCAL OF EN BERTRANS DE BORN 
Lady, since you care nothing for me, 
And since you have shut me away from you 
Causelessly, 
I know not wnere to go seeking, 
For certainly 
I will never again gather 
Joy so rich, and if I find not ever 
A lady with look so speaking 
To my desire, worth yours whom I have lost, 
I’ll have no other love at any cost. 

And since I could not find a peer to you, 
Neither one so fair, nor of such heart, 
So eager and alert, 
Nor with such art 
In attire, nor so gay 
Nor with gift so bountiful and so true, 
I will go out a-searching, 
Culling from each a fair trait 
To make me a borrowed lady 
Till I again find you ready. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Bels Cembelins, I take of you your colour, 
For it's your own, and your glance 
Where love is, 
A proud thing I do here, 
For, as to colour and eyes 
I shall have missed nothing at all, 
Having yours. 
I ask of Midons Aelis (of Montfort) 
Her straight speech free-running, 
That my phantom lack not in cunning, 

At Chalais of the Viscountess, I would 
That she give me outright 
Her two hands and her throat, 
So take I my road 
To Rochechouart, 



Swift-foot to my Lady Anhes, 
Seeing that Tristan's lady Iseutz had never 
Such grace of locks, I do ye to wit, 
Though she'd the far fame for it. 

Of Audiart at Malemort, 
Though she with a full heart 
Wish me ill, 
I'd have her form that's laced 
So cunningly, 
Without blemish, for her love 
Breaks not nor turns aside. 
I of Miels-de-ben demand 
Her straight fresh body, 
She is so supple and young, 
Her robes can but do her wrong. 

Her white teeth, of the Lady Faidita 
I ask, and the fine courtesy 
She hath to welcome one, 
And such replies she lavishes 
Within her nest;

<|startoftext|>
Of Bels Mirals, the rest, 
Tall stature and gaiety, 
To make these avail 
She knoweth well, betide 
No change nor turning aside. 

Ah, Bels Senher, Maent, at last 
I ask naught from you, 
Save that I have such hunger for 
This phantom 
As I've for you, such flame-lap, 
And yet I'd rather 
Ask of you than hold another, 
Mayhap, right close and kissed. 
Ah, lady, why have you cast 
Me out, knowing you hold me so fast! 




Donna Mi Prega 

Because a lady asks me, I would tell 
Of an affect that comes often and is fell 
And is so overweening; Love by name. 
E'en its deniers can now hear the truth, 
I for the nonce to them that know it call, 
Having no hope at all 
that man who is base in heart 
Can bear his part of wit 
into the light of it, 
And save they know't aright from nature's source 
I have no will to prove Love's course 
or say 
Where he takes rest; who maketh him to be; 
Or what his active virtu is, or what his force; 
Nay, nor his very essence or his mode; 
What his placation; why he is in verb, 
Or if a man have might 
To show him visible to men's sight. 
In memory's locus taketh he his state Place 
Formed there in manner as a mist of light 
Upon a dusk that is come from Mars and stays. 
Love is created, hath a sensate name, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
His modus takes from soul, from heart his will; 
From form seen doth he start, that, understood, 
Taketh in latent intellect 
As in a subject ready 
place and abode, 
Yet in that place it ever is unstill, 
Spreading its rays, it tendeth never down 
By quality, but is its own effect unendingly 
Not to delight, but in an ardour of thought 
That the base likeness of it kindleth not. 
It is not virtu, but perfection's source 
Lying within perfection postulate 
Not by the reason, but ‘tis felt, I say. 
Beyond salvation, holdeth its judging force, 
Maintains intention reason's peer and mate; 
Poor in discernment, being thus weakness' friend, 
Often his power meeteth with death in the end 



Be he withstayed 
or from true course 
bewrayed 
E'en though he meet not with hate or villeiny 
Save that perfection fails, be it but a little; 
Nor can man say he hath his life by chance 
Or that he hath not stablished seigniory 
Or loseth power, e'en lost to memory. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
He comes to be and is when will's so great 
It twists itself from out all natural measure; 
Leisure s adornment puts he then never on, 
Never thereafter, but moves changing state, 
Moves changing colour, or to laugh or weep 
Or wries the face with fear and little stays, 
Yea, resteth little 
yet is found the most 
Where folk of worth be host. 
And his strange property sets sighs to move 
And wills man look into unformed space 
Rousing there thirst 
that breaketh into flame. 
None can imagine love 
that knows not love; 
Love doth not move, but draweth all to him; 
Nor doth he turn 
for a whim 
to find delight 
Nor to seek out, surely, 
great knowledge or slight. 
Look drawn from like, 
delight maketh certain in seeming 
Nor can in covert cower, 
beauty so near, 
Not yet wild-cruel as darts, 
So hath man craft from fear 
in such his desire 
To follow a noble spirit, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
edge, that is, and point to the dart, 
Though from her face indiscernible; 
He, caught, falleth 
plumb the spike of the targe. 



Who well proceedeth, form not seeth, 
following his own emanation. 
There, beyond colour, essence set apart, 
In midst of darkness light light giveth forth 
Beyond all falsity, worthy of faith, alone 
That in him solely is compassion born. 

Safe may'st thou go my canzon whither thee pleaseth 
Thou art so fair attired that every man and each 
Shall praise thy speech 
So we have sense or glow with reason's fire, 
To stand with other 
hast thou no desire. 




Dum Capitolium Scandet 

How many will come after me 
singing as well as I sing, none better; 
Telling the heart of their truth 
as I have taught them to tell it; 
Fruit of my seed, 
O my unnameable children. 
Know then that I loved you from afore-time, 
Clear speakers, naked in the sun, untrammelled.

E.P. Ode Pour L'Election De Son Sepulchre 
For three years, out of key with his time, 
He strove to resuscitate the dead art 
Of poetry; to maintain "the sublime" 
In the old sense. Wrong from the start-


No, hardly, but seeing he had been born 
In a half savage country, out of date; 
Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn; 
Capaneus; trout for factitious bait; 

Idmen gar toi panth, hos eni troie 
Caught in the unstopped ear; 
Giving the rocks small lee-way 
The chopped seas held him, therefore, that year. 

His true Penelope was Flaubert, 
He fished by obstinate isles; 
Observed the elegance of Circe's hair 
Rather than the mottoes on sun-dials. 

Unaffected by "the march of events," 
He passed from men's memory in l'an trentuniesme 
de son eage;the case presents 
No adjunct to the Muses' diadem. 

II 
The age demanded an image 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of its accelerated grimace, 
Something for the modern stage 
Not, at any rate, an Attic grace; 

Not, certainly, the obscure reveries 
Of the inward gaze; 
Better mendacities 
Than the classics in paraphrase! 

The "age demanded" chiefly a mould in plaster, 
Made with no loss of time, 
A prose kinema, not, not assuredly, alabaster 



Or the "sculpture" of rhyme. 

III 
The tea-rose tea-gown, etc. 
Supplants the mousseline of Cos, 
The pianola "replaces" 
Sappho's barbitos. 

Christ follows Dionysus, 
Phallic and ambrosial 
Made way for macerations; 
Caliban casts out Ariel. 

All things are a flowing 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Sage Heracleitus say; 
But a tawdry cheapness 
Shall outlast our days. 

Even the Christian beauty 
Defects--after Samothrace; 
We see to kalon 
Decreed in the market place. 

Faun's flesh is not to us, 
Nor the saint's vision. 
We have the press for wafer; 
Franchise for circumcision. 

All men, in law, are equals. 
Free of Pisistratus, 
We choose a knave or an eunuch 
To rule over us. 

O bright Apollo, 
Tin andra, tin heroa, tina theon, 
What god, man or hero 
Shall I place a tin wreath upon! 

IV 
These fought in any case, 
And some believing,
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

 pro domo, in any case... 



Some quick to arm, 
some for adventure, 
some from fear of weakness, 
some from fear of censure, 
some for love of slaughter, in imagination, 
learning later... 
some in fear, learning love of slaughter; 

Died some, pro patria,

 non "dulce" not "et decor"... 
walked eye-deep in hell 
believing old men's lies, then unbelieving 
came home, home to a lie, 
home to many deceits, 
home to old lies and new infamy; 
usury age-old and age-thick 
and liars in public places. 

Daring as never before, wastage as never before. 
Young blood and high blood, 
fair cheeks, and fine bodies; 

fortitude as never before 

frankness as never before, 
disillusions as never told in the old days, 
hysterias, trench confessions, 
laughter out of dead bellies. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

V 
There died a myriad, 
And of the best, among them, 
For an old bitch gone in the teeth, 
For a botched civilization, 

Charm, smiling at the good mouth, 
Quick eyes gone under earth's lid, 

For two gross of broken statues, 
For a few thousand battered books. 






Envoi 

Go, dumb-born book, 
Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes: 
Hadst thou but song 
As thou hast subjects known, 
Then were there cause in thee that should condone 
Even my faults that heavy upon me lie 
And build her glories their longevity. 
Tell her that sheds 
Such treasure in the air, 
Recking naught else but that her graces give 
Life to the moment, 
I would bid them live 
As roses might, in magic amber laid, 
Red overwrought with orange and all made 
One substance and one colour 
Braving time. 
Tell her that goes 
With song upon her lips 
But sings not out the song, nor knows 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The maker of it, some other mouth, 
May be as fair as hers, 
Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers, 
When our two dusts with Waller's shall be laid, 
Siftings on siftings in oblivion, 
Till change hath broken down 
All things save Beauty alone. 




Epilogue 

O chansons foregoing 
You were a seven days' wonder. 
When you came out in the magazines 
You created considerable stir in Chicago, 
And now you are stale and worn out, 
You're a very depleted fashion, 
A hoop-skirt, a calash, 
An homely, transient antiquity. 
Only emotion remains. 
Your emotions? 
Are those of a maitre-de-cafe.

Fu I 

Fu I loved the high cloud and the hill, 
Alas, he died of alcohol. 
Li Po 
And Li Po also died drunk. 

He tried to embrace a moon 
In the Yellow River. 



Erat Hora 

‘Thank you, whatever comes.' And then she turned 
And, as the ray of sun on hanging flowers 
Fades when the wind hath lifted them aside, 
Went swiftly from me. Nay, whatever comes 
One hour was sunlit and the most high gods 
May not make boast of any better thing 
Than to have watched that hour as it passed.

Exile’s Letter 

To So-Kin of Rakuyo, ancient friend, Chancellor of 
Gen. 
Now I remember that you built me a special tavern 
By the south side of the bridge at Ten-Shin. 
With yellow gold and white jewels, we paid for songs 
and laughter 
And we were drunk for month on month, forgetting the 
kings and princes. 
Intelligent men came drifting in from the sea and from 
the west border, 
And with them, and with you especially 
There was nothing at cross purpose, 
And they made nothing of sea-crossing or of mountain-
crossing, 
If only they could be of that fellowship, 
And we all spoke out our hearts and minds, and without 
regret. 
And when I was sent off to South Wei, 
smothered in laurel groves, 
And you to the north of Raku-hoku, 
Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories in 
common. 
And then, when separation had come to its worst, 
We met, and travelled into Sen-Go, 
Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and 
twisting waters, 
Into a valley of the thousand bright flowers, 
That was the first valley; 
And into ten thousand valleys full of voices and pine-
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
winds. 
And with silver harness and reins of gold, 
Out came the East of Kan foreman and his company. 
And there came also the ‘True man’ of Shi-yo to meet 
me, 
Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ. 
In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us more 
Sennin music, 
Many instruments, like the sound of young phoenix 
broods. 



The foreman of Kan Chu, drunk, danced 
because his long sleeves wouldn't keep still 
With that music playing, 
And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my 
head on his lap, 
And my spirit so high it was all over the heavens, 
And before the end of the day we were scattered like 
stars, or rain. 
I had to be off to So, far away over the waters, 
You back to your river-bridge. 

And your father, who was brave as a leopard, 
Was governor in Hei Shu, and put down the barbarian 
rabble. 
And one May he had you send for me, 
despite the long distance. 
And what with broken wheels and so on, I won't say it 
wasn't hard going, 
Over roads twisted like sheep's guts. 
And I was still going, late in the year, 
in the cutting wind from the North, 
And thinking how little you cared for the cost, 
and you caring enough to pay it. 
And what a reception: 
Red jade cups, food well set on a blue jewelled table, 
And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning. 
And you would walk out with me to the western corner 
of the castle, 
To the dynastic temple, with water about it clear as 
blue jade, 
With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
drums, 
With ripples like dragon-scales, going grass green on the 
water, 
Pleasure lasting, with courtezans, going and coming 
without hindrance, 
With the willow flakes falling like snow, 
And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset, 
And the water, a hundred feet deep, reflecting green 
eyebrows 
Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young 
moonlight, 



Gracefully painted 
And the girls singing back at each other, 
Dancing in transparent brocade, 
And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it, 
Tossing it up under the clouds. 
And all this comes to an end. 
And is not again to be met with. 
I went up to the court for examination, 
Tried Layu's luck, offered the Choyo song, 
And got no promotion, 
and went back to the East Mountains 
White-headed. 
And once again, later, we met at the South bridge-head. 
And then the crowd broke up, you went north to San 
palace, 
And if you ask how I regret that parting: 
It is like the flowers falling at Spring's end 
Confused, whirled in a tangle. 
What is the use of talking, and there is no end of talking, 
There is no end of things in the heart. 
I call in the boy, 
Have him sit on his knees here 
To seal this, 
And send it a thousand miles, thinking.

Wal, Thanksgivin' do be comin' round. 
With the price of turkeys on the bound, 
And coal, by gum! Thet were just found, 
Is surely gettin' cheaper. 

The winds will soon begin to howl, 
And winter, in its yearly growl, 
Across the medders begin to prowl, 
And Jack Frost gettin' deeper. 

By shucks! It seems to me, 
That you I orter be 
Thankful, that our Ted could see 
A way to operate it. 

I sez to Mandy, sure, sez I, 
I'll bet thet air patch o' rye 
Thet he'll squash 'em by-and-by, 
And he did, by cricket! 

No use talkin', he's the man One 
of the best thet ever ran, 
Fer didn't I turn Republican 
One o' the fust? 

I 'lowed as how he'd beat the rest, 
But old Si Perkins, he hemmed and guessed, 
And sed as how it wuzn't best 
To meddle with the trust.

Your songs? 
Oh! The little mothers 
Will sing them in the twilight, 
And when the night 
Shrinketh the kiss of the dawn 
That loves and kills, 
What time the swallow fills 
Here note, the little rabbit folk 
That some call children, 
Such as are up and wide, 
Will laugh your verses to each other, 
Pulling on their shoes for the day's business, 
Serious child business that the world 
Laughs at, and grows stale; 
Such is the tale 
-Part of it-of thy song-life. 

Mine? 

A book is known by them that read 
That same. Thy public in my screed 
Is listed. Well! Some score years hence 
Behold mine audience, 
As we had seen him yesterday. 

Scrawny, be-spectacled, out at heels, 
Such an one as the world feels 
A sort of curse against its guzzling 
And its age-lasting wallow for red greed 
And yet; full speed 
Though it should run for its own getting, 
Will turn aside to sneer at 
'Cause he hath 
No coin, no will to snatch the aftermath 
Of Mammon 
Such an one as women draw away from 
For the tobacco ashes scattered on his coat 
And sith his throat 
Show's razor's unfamiliarity 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


And three days' beard; 

Such an one picking a ragged 
Backless copy from the stall, 
Too cheap for cataloguing, 
Loquitur, 

'Ah-eh! the strange rare name . . . 
Ah-eh! He must be rare if even 7 have not . . .’ 
And lost mid-page 
Such age 
As his pardons the habit, 
He analyses form and thought to see 
How I 'scaped immortality. 




Fan-Piece, For Her Imperial Lord 

O fan of white silk,

Fish And Shadow 

The salmon-trout drifts in the stream, 
The soul of the salmon-trout floats over the stream 
Like a little wafer of light. 

The salmon moves in the sun-shot, bright shallow sea. . . . 

As light as the shadow of the fish 
that falls through the water, 
She came into the large room by the stair, 
Yawning a little she came with the sleep still upon her. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
'I am just from bed. The sleep is still in my eyes. 
'Come. I have had a long dream.' 
And I: That wood? 
'And two springs have passed us.' 
'Not so far, no, not so far now, 
There is a place but no one else knows it 
A field in a valley . . . 
Qu'ieu sui avinen, 
Ieu lo sai,' 

She must speak of the time 
Of Arnaut de Mareuil, I thought, 'qu'ieu sui avinen.’ 

Light as the shadow of the fish 
That falls through the pale green water. 




For E. Mcc 

Gone while your tastes were keen to you, 
Gone where the grey winds call to you, 
By that high fencer, even Death, 
Struck of the blade that no man parrieth; 
Such is your fence, one saith, 
One that hath known you. 
Drew you your sword most gallantly 
Made you your pass most valiantly 
'Gainst that grey fencer, even Death. 

Gone as a gust of breath 
Faith! no man tarrieth, 
‘Se il cor ti manca,’ but it failed thee not! 
'Non ti fidar,’ it is the sword that speaks 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
‘In me.’ 

Thou trusted'st in thyself and met the blade 
'Thout mask or gauntlet, and art laid 
As memorable broken blades that be 
Kept as bold trophies of old pageantry. 
As old Toledos past their days of war 
Are kept mnemonic of the strokes they bore, 
So art thou with us, being good to keep 
In our heart's sword-rack, though thy sword-arm sleep. 

ENVOI 
Struck of the blade that no man parrieth 
Pierced of the point that toucheth lastly all, 
'Gainst that grey fencer, even Death, 
Behold the shield! He shall not take thee all. 




Francesca 

You came in out of the night 
And there were flowers in your hand, 
Now you will come out of a confusion of people, 
Out of a turmoil of speech about you. 

I who have seen you amid the primal things 
Was angry when they spoke your name 
IN ordinary places. 
I would that the cool waves might flow over my mind, 
And that the world should dry as a dead leaf, 
Or as a dandelion see-pod and be swept away, 
So that I might find you again, 
Alone. 




Fratres Minores

With minds still hovering above their testicles 
Certain poets here and in France 
Still sigh over established and natural fact 
Long since fully discussed by Ovid. 
They howl. They complain in delicate and exhausted metres 
That the twitching of three abdominal nerves 
Is incapable of producing a lasting Nirvana. 




From "Hugh Selwyn Mauberly" 

For three years, out of key with his time, 
He strove to resuscitate the dead art 
Of poetry; to maintain "the sublime" 
In the old from the start-


No, hardly, but seeing he had been born 
In a half-savage country, out of date; 
Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn; 
Capaneus; trout for factitious bait; 

[idmen gar toi pant, hos eni Troiei] 
Caught in the unstopped ear; 
Giving the rocks small lee-way 
The chopped seas held him, therefore, that year. 

His true Penelope was Flaubert, 
He fished by obstinate isles; 
Observed the elegance of Circe's hair 
Rather than the mottoes on sun-dials. 

Unaffected by "the march of events," 
He passed from men's memory in l'an trentuniesme 
De son eage; the case presents 
No adjunct to the Muses' diadem.

Further Instructions 

Come, my songs, let us express our baser passions. 
Let us express our envy for the man with a steady job and no worry about the 
future. 
You are very idle, my songs, 
I fear you will come to a bad end. 
You stand about the streets, You loiter at the corners and bus-stops, 
You do next to nothing at all. 

You do not even express our inner nobilitys, 
You will come to a very bad end. 

And I? I have gone half-cracked. 
I have talked to you so much that I almost see you about me, 
Insolent little beasts! Shameless! Devoid of clothing! 

But you, newest song of the lot, 
You are not old enough to have done much mischief. 
I will get you a green coat out of China 
With dragons worked upon it. 
I will get you the scarlet silk trousers 
From the statue of the infant Christ at Santa Maria Novella; 
Lest they say we are lacking in taste, 
Or that there is no caste in this family.

Gentildonna 

She passed and left no quiver in the veins, who now 
Moving among the trees, and clinging

Fanning the grass she walked on then, endures: 
Grey olive leaves beneath a rain-cold sky. 




Grace Before Song 

Lord God of heaven that with mercy dight 
Th'alternate prayer wheel of the night and light 
Eternal hath to thee, and in whose sight 
Our days as rain drops in the sea surge fall, 

As bright white drops upon a leaden sea 
Grant so my songs to this grey folk may be: 

As drops that dream and gleam and falling catch the sun 
Evan'scent mirrors every opal one 
Of such his splendor as their compass is, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
So, bold My Songs, seek ye such death as this. 




Guido Invites You Thus 

‘Lappo I leave behind and Dante too, 
Lo, I would sail the seas with thee alone! 
Talk me no love talk, no bought-cheap fiddl’ry, 
Mine is the ship and thine the merchandise, 
All the blind earth knows not th'emprise 
Whereto thou calledst and whereto I call. 

Lo, I have seen thee bound about with dreams, 
Lo, I have known thy heart and its desire; 
Life, all of it, my sea, and all men's streams 
Are fused in it as flames of an altar fire ! 
Lo, thou hast voyaged not! The ship is mine.' 




Heather 

The black panther treads at my side, 
And above my fingers 
There float the petal-like flames. 

The milk-white girls 
Unbend from the holly-trees, 
And their snow-white leopard

<|startoftext|>
Watches to follow our trace. 




Her Monument, The Image Cut Thereon 

FROM THE ITALIAN OF LEOPARDI 

Such wast thou, 
Who art now 
But buried dust and rusted skeleton. 
Above the bones and mire, 
Motionless, placed in vain, 
Mute mirror of the flight of speeding years, 
Sole guard of grief 
Sole guard of memory 
Standeth this image of the beauty sped. 

O glance, when thou wast still as thou art now, 
How hast thou set the fire 
A-tremble in men's veins; lip curved high 
To mind me of some urn of full delight, 
O throat girt round of old with swift desire, 
O palms of Love, that in your wonted ways 
Not once but many a day 
Felt hands turn ice a-sudden, touching ye, 
That ye were once! of all the grace ye had 
That which remaineth now 
Shameful, most sad 
Finds 'neath this rock fit mould, fit resting place! 

And still when fate recalleth, 
Even that semblance that appears amongst us 
Is like to heaven's most 'live imagining. 
All, all our life's eternal mystery! 
To-day, on high 
Mounts, from our mighty thoughts and from the fount 
Of sense untellable, Beauty 
That seems to be some quivering splendour cast 
By the immortal nature on this quicksand, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

And by surhuman fates 
Given to mortal state 
To be a sign and an hope made secure 
Of blissful kingdoms and the aureate spheres; 



And on the morrow, by some lightsome twist, 
Shameful in sight, abject, abominable 
All this angelic aspect can return 
And be but what it was 
With all the admirable concepts that moved from it 
Swept from the mind with it in its departure. 

Infinite things desired, lofty visions 
'Got on desirous thoughts by natural virtue, 
And the wise concord, whence through delicious seas 
The arcane spirit of the whole Mankind 
Turns hardy pilot . . . and if one wrong note 
Strike the tympanum, 
Instantly 
That paradise is hurled to nothingness. 

O mortal nature, 
If thou art 
Frail and so vile in all, 
How canst thou reach so high with thy poor sense; 
Yet if thou art 
Noble in any part 
How is the noblest of thy speech and thought 
So lightly wrought 
Or to such base occasion lit and quenched? 




Historion 

No man hath dared to write this thing as yet, 
And yet I know, how that the souls of all men great 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
At times pass athrough us, 
And we are melted into them, and are not 
Save reflexions of their souls. 
Thus am I Dante for a space and am 
One Francois Villon, ballad-lord and thief, 
Or am such holy ones I may not write 
Lest blasphemy be writ against my name; 
This for an instant and the flame is gone. 

'Tis as in midmost us there glows a sphere 
Translucent, molten gold, that is the "I" 
And into this some form projects itself: 
Christus, or John, or eke the Florentine; 
And as the clear space is not if a form's 
Imposed thereon, 
So cease we from all being for the time, 
And these, the Masters of the Soul, live on.

Shades of Callimachus, Coan ghosts of Philetas 
It is in your grove I would walk, 
I who come first from the clear font 
Bringing the Grecian orgies into Italy, 
and the dance into Italy. 
Who hath taught you so subtle a measure, 
in what hall have you heard it; 
What foot beat out your time-bar, 
what water has mellowed your whistles ? 

Out-weariers of Apollo will, as we know, continue their 
Martian generalities, 
We have kept our erasers in order. 
A new-fangled chariot follows the flower-hung horses; 
A young Muse with young loves clustered about her 
ascends with me into the aether, . . . 
And there is no high-road to the Muses. 

Annalists will continue to record Roman reputations, 
Celebrities from the Trans-Caucasus will belaud Roman celebrities

And expound the distentions of Empire, 
But for something to read in normal circumstances? 
For a few pages brought down from the forked hill unsullied? 
I ask a wreath which will not crush my head. 
And there is no hurry about it; 
I shall have, doubtless, a boom after my funeral, 
Seeing that long standing increases all things 
regardless of quality. 
And who would have known the towers 
pulled down by a deal-wood horse; 
Or of Achilles withstaying waters by Simois 
Or of Hector spattering wheel-rims, 
Or of Polydmantus, by Scamander, or Helenas and 
Deiphoibos? 
Their door-yards would scarcely know them, or Paris. 
Small talk O Ilion, and O Troad 
twice taken by Oetian gods, 
If Homer had not stated your case! 



And I also among the later nephews of this city 
shall have my dog's day, 
With no stone upon my contemptible sepulchre; 
My vote coming from the temple of Phoebus in Lycia, at Patara, 
And in the mean time my songs will travel, 
And the devirginated young ladies will enjoy them 
when they have got over the strangeness, 
For Orpheus tamed the wild beasts 
and held up the Threician river; 
And Citharaon shook up the rocks by Thebes 
and danced them into a bulwark at his pleasure, 
And you, O Polyphemus? Did harsh Galatea almost

Bacchus and Apollo in favour of it, 
There will be a crowd of young women doing homage to my palaver, 
Though my house is not propped up by Taenarian 
columns from Laconia (associated with Neptune and Cerberus), 
Though it is not stretched upon gilded beams; 
My orchards do not lie level and wide 
as the forests of Phaecia, 
the luxurious and Ionian, 
Nor are my caverns stuffed stiff with a Marcian vintage, 
My cellar does not date from Numa Pompilius, 
Nor bristle with wine jars, 
Nor is it equipped with a frigidaire patent; 
Yet the companions of the Muses 
will keep their collective nose in my books, 
And weary with historical data, they will turn to my dance tune. 
Happy who are mentioned in my pamphlets, 
the songs shall be a fine tomb-stone over their beauty. 
But against this ? 
Neither expensive pyramids scraping the stars in their route, 
Nor houses modelled upon that of Jove in East Elis, 
Nor the monumental effigies of Mausolus, 
are a complete elucidation of death. 

Flame burns, rain sinks into the cracks 
And they all go to rack ruin beneath the thud of the years. 
Stands genius a deathless adornment, 
a name not to be worn out with the years.

The water dripping from Bellerophon's horse,

Alba, your kings, and the realm your folk 
have constructed with such industry 
Shall be yawned out on my lyre with such industry. 
My little mouth shall gobble in such great fountains, 
'Wherefrom father Ennius, sitting before I came, hath drunk.' 
I had rehearsed the Curian brothers, and made remarks 
on the Horatian javelin 
(Near Q. H. Flaccus' book-stall). 
'Of’ royal Aemilia, drawn on the memorial raft, 
'Of’ the victorious delay of Fabius, and the left-handed 
battle at Cannae, 
Of lares fleeing the 'Roman seat' . . . 
I had sung of all these 
And of Hannibal, 
and of Jove protected by geese. 
And Phoebus looking upon me from the Castalian tree, 
Said then 'You idiot! What are you doing with that water: 
‘Who has ordered a book about heroes? 
'You need, Propertius, not think 
'About acquiring that sort of a reputation. 
'Soft fields must be worn by small wheels, 
'Your pamphlets will be thrown, thrown often into a chair 
'Where a girl waits alone for her lover; 
'Why wrench your page out of its course? 
'No keel will sink with your genius 
'Let another oar churn the water, 
'Another wheel, the arena; mid-crowd is as bad as mid-sea.' 
He had spoken, and pointed me a place with his plectrum:

Orgies of vintages, an earthern image of Silenus 
Strengthened with rushes, Tegaean Pan, 
The small birds of the Cytharean mother, 
their Punic faces dyed in the Gorgon's lake; 
Nine girls, from as many countrysides 

bearing her offerings in their unhardened hands, 
Such my cohort and setting. And she bound ivy to his thyrsos; 



Fitted song to the strings; 
Roses twined in her hands. 
And one among them looked at me with face offended, 
Calliope: 
'Content ever to move with white swans! 
'Nor will the noise of high horses lead you ever to battle; 
Nor will the public criers ever have your name; 
in their classic horns, 
'Nor Mars shout you in the wood at Aeonium, 
Nor where Rome ruins German riches, 
'Nor where the Rhine flows with barbarous blood, 
and flood carries wounded Suevi. 
'Obviously crowned lovers at unknown doors, 
'Night dogs, the marks of a drunken scurry, 
'These are your images, and from you the sorcerizing of 
shut-in young ladies, 
'The wounding of austere men by chicane.' 
Thus Mistress Calliope, 
Dabbling her hands in the fount, thus she 
Stiffened our face with the backwash of Philetas the Coan.

Midnight, and a letter comes to me from our mistress: 
Telling me to come to Tibur: 
At once!! 
'Bright tips reach up from twin towers, 
'Anienan spring water falls into flat-spread pools.' 

What is to be done about it? 
Shall I entrust myself to entangled shadows, 
Where bold hands may do violence to my person? 
Yet if I postpone my obedience 
because of this respectable terror, 
I shall be prey to lamentations worse than a nocturnal assailant. 
And I shall be in the wrong, 
it will last a twelve month, 
For her hands have no kindness me-ward, 

Nor is there anyone to whom lovers are not sacred at midnight 
And in the Via Sciro. 
If any man would be a lover 
he may walk on the Scythian coast, 
No barbarism would go to the extent of doing him harm,

Cupid will carry lighted torches before him 
and keep mad dogs off his ankles.

She would bring frankincense and wreaths to my tomb, 
She would sit like an ornament on my pyre.

With crowds too assiduous in their crossing of it; 
For thus are tombs of lovers most desecrated.

At any rate I shall not hav.e my epitaph in a high road.

DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH 
LYGDAMUS 

Tell me the truths which you hear of our constant young lady, 
Lygdamus, 
And may the bought yoke of a mistress lie with 
equitable weight on your shoulders; 
For I am swelled up with inane pleasurabilities 
and deceived by your reference 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To things which you think I would like to believe. 

No messenger should come wholly empty, 
and a slave should fear plausibilities; 
Much conversation is as good as having a home. 
Out with it, tell it to me, all of it, from the beginning, 
I guzzle with outstretched ears. 
Thus? She wept into uncombed hair, 
And you saw it. 
Vast waters flowed from her eyes ? 
You, you Lygdamus 
Saw her stretched on her bed, 
was no glimpse in a mirror; 
No gawds on her snowy hands, no orfevrerie, 
Sad garment draped on her slender arms. 
Her escritoires lay shut by the bed-feet. 
Sadness hung over the house, and the desolated female attendants 
Were desolated because she had told them her dreams. 

She was veiled in the midst of that place, 
Damp woolly handkerchiefs were stuffed into her undryable eyes, 
And a querulous noise responded to our solicitous reprobations. 
For which things you will get a reward from me, Lygdamus? 
To say many things is equal to having a home. 
And the other woman 'has not enticed me 
by her pretty manners, 
'She has caught me with herbaceous poison, 
she twiddles the spiked wheel of a rhombus, 
'She stews puffed frogs, snake's bones, the moulted

May the gout cramp up her feet!

And you expect me to believe this

The twisted rhombs ceased their clamour of accompaniment;

Slow foot, or swift foot, death delays but for a season.

Go back to Great Dian's dances bearing suitable gifts, 
Pay up your vow of night watches

And unto me also pay debt:

Now if ever it is time to cleanse Helicon; 
to lead Emathian horses afield, 
And to name over the census of my chiefs in the Roman camp. 
If I have not the faculty, 'The bare attempt would be praise-worthy.' 
'In the things of similar magnitude 
the mere will to act is sufficient.' 
The primitive ages sang Venus, 
the last sings of a tumult, 
And I also will sing war when this matter of a girl is exhausted. 
I with my beak hauled ashore would proceed in a more stately manner, 
My Muse is eager to instruct me in a new gamut, or gambetto, 
Up, up my soul, from your lowly cantilation, 
put on a timely vigour. 
Oh august Pierides! Now for a large-mouthed product. 
Thus: 
'The Euphrates denies its protection to the Parthian and 
apologizes for Crassus,' 
And 'It is, I think, India which now gives necks to your triumph,' 
And so forth, Augustus. 'Virgin Arabia shakes in her inmost dwelling.' 
If any land shrink into a distant seacoast, 
it is a mere postponement of your domination. 
And I shall follow the camp, I shall be duly celebrated 
for singing the affairs of your cavalry. 
May the fates watch over my day.

Yet you ask on what account I write so many love-lyrics 
And whence this soft book comes into my mouth. 
Neither Calliope nor Apollo sung these things into my ear, 
My genius is no more than a girl. 

If she with ivory fingers drive a tune through the lyre, 
We look at the process. 
How easy the moving fingers; if hair is mussed on her forehead, 
If she goes in a gleam of Cos, in a slither of dyed stuff, 
There is a volume in the matter; if her eyelids sink into sleep, 
There are new jobs for the author; 
And if she plays with me with her shirt off, 



We shall construct many Iliads. 
And whatever she does or says 
We shall spin long yarns out of nothing. 

Thus much the fates have allotted me, and if, Maecenas, 
I were able to lead heroes into armour, I would not, 
Neither would I warble of Titans, nor of Ossa 
spiked onto Olympus, 
Nor of causeways over Pelion, 
Nor of Thebes in its ancient respectability, 
nor of Homer's reputation in Pergamus, 
Nor of Xerxes' two-barreled kingdom, nor of Remus and his royal family, 
Nor of dignified Carthaginian characters, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Nor of Welsh mines and the profit Marus had out of them, 
I should remember Caesar's affairs . . . 
for a background, 
Although Callimachus did without them, 
and without Theseus, 
Without an inferno, without Achilles attended of gods, 
Without Ixion, and without the sons of Menoetius and 
the Argo and without Jove's grave and the Titans. 

And my ventricles do not palpitate to Caesarial ore rotundas, 
Nor to the tune of the Phrygian fathers. 
Sailor, of winds; a plowman, concerning his oxen; 
Soldier, the enumeration of wounds; the sheep-feeder, of ewes; 
We, in our narrow bed, turning aside from battles: 
Each man where he can, wearing out the day in his manner.

Moving naked over Acheron 
Upon the one raft, victor and conquered together, 
Marius and Jugurtha together, 
one tangle of shadows. 
Caesar plots against India, 
Tigris and Euphrates shall, from now on, flow at his bidding, 
Tibet shall be full of Roman policemen, 
The Parthians shall get used to our statuary

Nor shall it be on an Atalic bed; 
The perfumed cloths shall be absent. 
A small plebeian procession. 
Enough, enough and in plenty 
There will be three books at my obsequies 
Which I take, my not unworthy gift, to Persephone. 

You will follow the bare scarified breast 
Nor will you be weary of calling my name, nor too weary 
To place the last kiss on my lips 
When the Syrian onyx is broken.

'Was once the slave of one passion:' 
Give that much inscription 
‘Death why tardily come?'

Me happy, night, night full of brightness; 
Oh couch made happy by iny long delectations; 
How many words talked out with abundant candles; 
Struggles when the lights were taken away; 
Now with bared breasts she wrestled against me, 
Tunic spread in delay; 
And she then opening my eyelids fallen in sleep, 
Her lips upon them; and it was her mouth saying: 
Sluggard! 

In how many varied embraces, our changing arms, 
Her kisses, how many, lingering on my lips. 
'Turn not Venus into a blinded motion, 
Eyes are the guides of love, 
Paris took Helen naked coming from the bed of Menelaus, 
Endymion's naked body, bright bait for Diana,' 
such at least is the story. 

While our fates twine together, sate we our eyes with love; 
For long night comes upon you 
and a day when no day returns. 
Let the gods lay chains upon us 
so that no day shall unbind them. 

Fool who would set a term to love's madness, 
For the sun shall drive with black horses, 
earth shall bring wheat from barley, 
The flood shall move toward the fountain 
Ere love know moderations, 
The fish shall swim in dry streams. 
No, now while it may be, let not the fruit of life cease. 
Dry wreaths drop their petals, 
their stalks are woven in baskets, 
To-day we take the great breath of lovers, 
<|endoftext|>

to-morrow fate shuts us in. 

Though you give all your kisses 
you give but few. 



Nor can I shift my pains to other, 
Hers will I be dead, 
If she confer such nights upon me, 
long is my life, long in years, 
If she give me many, 
God am I for the time.

Jove, be merciful to that unfortunate woman 
Or an ornamental death will be held to your debit, 
The time is come, the air heaves in torridity, 
The dry earth pants against the canicular heat, 
But this heat is not the root of the matter: 
She did not respect all the gods;

And what they swore in the cupboard

There comes, it seems, and at any rate

The gentler hour of an ultimate day. 

Io mooed the first years with averted head, 
And now drinks Nile water like a god, 
Ino in her young days fled pellmell out of Thebes, 
Andromeda was offered to a sea-serpent

Callisto, disguised as a bear, 
wandered through the Arcadian prairies 
While a black veil was over her stars, 
What if your fates are accelerated, 
your quiet hour put forward, 
You may find interment pleasing, 

You will say that you succumbed to a danger identical, 
charmingly identical, with Semele's, 
And believe it, and she also will believe it, 
being expert from experience, 
And amid all the gloried and storied beauties of Maeonia 
There shall be none in a better seat, not 



one denying your prestige, 

Now you may bear fate's stroke unperturbed, 
Or Jove, harsh as he is, may turn aside your ultimate day.

.Light, light of my eyes, at an exceeding late hour I was wandering, 
And intoxicated, 
and no servant was leading me, 
And a minute crowd of small boys came from opposite, 
I do not know what boys, 
And I am afraid of numerical estimate, 
And some of them shook little torches, 
and others held onto arrows, 
And the rest laid their chains upon me, 
and they were naked, the lot of them, 
And one of the lot was given to lust. 

'That incensed female has consigned him to our pleasure.' 
So spoke. And the noose was over my neck. 
And another said 'Get him plumb in the middle! 
'Shove along there, shove along!' 
And another broke in upon this: 
'He thinks that we are not gods,' 
'And she has been waiting for the scoundrel, 
and in a new Sidonian night cap, 
And with more than Arabian odours, 
God knows where he has been. 
She could scarcely keep her eyes open

We were coming near to the house,

And Cynthia was alone in her bed. 
I was stupefied. 
I had never seen her looking so beautiful, 
No, not when she was tunick'd in purple. 

Such aspect was presented to me, me recently emerged from my visions, 
You will observe that pure form has its value. 

‘You are a very early inspector of mistresses. 
‘Do you think I have adopted your habits?' 



There were upon the bed no signs of a voluptuous encounter, 
No signs of a second incumbent. 

She continued: 
'No incubus has crushed his body against me, 
‘Though spirits are celebrated for adultery. 
‘And I am going to the temple of Vesta . . .' 
and so on. 

Since that day I have had no pleasant nights.

Who, who will be the next man to entrust his girl to a friend? 
Love interferes with fidelities; 
The gods have brought shame on their relatives;

Amiable and harmonious people are pushed incontinent into duels,

And there was a case in Colchis, Jason and that woman in Colchis;

My talent acclaimed in their banquets, 
I shall be honoured with yesterday's wreaths. 
And the god strikes to the marrow. 

Like a trained and performing tortoise, 
I would make verse in your fashion, if she should command it, 
With her husband asking a remission of sentence, 
And even this infamy would not attract numerous readers 
Were there an erudite or violent passion, 
For the nobleness of the populace brooks nothing below its own altitude. 
One must have resonance, resonance and sonority . . . 
like a goose.

Varro sang Jason's expedition, 
Varro, of his great passion Leucadia, 
There is song in the parchment; Catullus the highly indecorous, 
Of Lesbia, known above Helen; 
And in the dyed pages of Calvus, 
Calvus mourning Quintilia, 
And but now Gallus had sung of Lycoris. 
Fair, fairest Lycoris 



The waters of Styx poured over the wound: 
And now Propertius of Cynthia, taking his stand among these. 




Horae Beatae Inscripto 

How will this beauty, when I am far hence, 
Sweep back upon me and engulf my mind! 

How will these hours, when we twain are gray, 
Turned in their sapphire tide, come flooding o'er us! 




Hugh Selwyn Mauberly (Part I) 

"Vocat aestus in umbram" 
Nemesianus Es. IV. 

E. P. Ode pour l'élection de son sépulchre 
For three years, out of key with his time, 
He strove to resuscitate the dead art 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of poetry; to maintain "the sublime" 
In the old sense. Wrong from the start -


No, hardly, but, seeing he had been born 
In a half savage country, out of date; 
Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn; 
Capaneus; trout for factitious bait: 

"Idmen gar toi panth, os eni Troie 
Caught in the unstopped ear; 
Giving the rocks small lee-way 
The chopped seas held him, therefore, that year. 

His true Penelope was Flaubert, 
He fished by obstinate isles; 
Observed the elegance of Circe's hair 
Rather than the mottoes on sun-dials. 

Unaffected by "the march of events", 
He passed from men's memory in l'an trentiesme 
De son eage; the case presents 
No adjunct to the Muses' diadem. 

II. 

The age demanded an image 
Of its accelerated grimace, 
Something for the modern stage, 
Not, at any rate, an Attic grace; 

Not, not certainly, the obscure reveries 
Of the inward gaze; 



Better mendacities 
Than the classics in paraphrase! 

The "age demanded" chiefly a mould in plaster, 
Made with no loss of time, 
A prose kinema, not, not assuredly, alabaster 
Or the "sculpture" of rhyme. 

<|endoftext|>

III. 

The tea-rose, tea-gown, etc. 
Supplants the mousseline of Cos, 
The pianola "replaces" 
Sappho's barbitos. 

Christ follows Dionysus, 
Phallic and ambrosial 
Made way for macerations; 
Caliban casts out Ariel. 

All things are a flowing, 
Sage Heracleitus says; 
But a tawdry cheapness 
Shall reign throughout our days. 

Even the Christian beauty 
Defects -- after Samothrace; 
We see to kalon 
Decreed in the market place. 

Faun's flesh is not to us, 
Nor the saint's vision. 
We have the press for wafer; 
Franchise for circumcision. 

All men, in law, are equals. 
Free of Peisistratus, 
We choose a knave or an eunuch 
To rule over us. 

A bright Apollo, 



tin andra, tin eroa, tina theon, 
What god, man, or hero 
Shall I place a tin wreath upon?

believing in old men's lies, then unbelieving 
came home, home to a lie, 
home to many deceits, 
home to old lies and new infamy; 

usury age-old and age-thick 
and liars in public places. 

Daring as never before, wastage as never before. 
Young blood and high blood, 
Fair cheeks, and fine bodies; 

fortitude as never before 

frankness as never before, 
disillusions as never told in the old days, 
hysterias, trench confessions, 
laughter out of dead bellies.

There died a myriad, 
And of the best, among them, 
For an old bitch gone in the teeth, 
For a botched civilization. 

Charm, smiling at the good mouth, 
Quick eyes gone under earth's lid, 

For two gross of broken statues, 
For a few thousand battered books. 

Yeux Glauques 

Gladstone was still respected, 
When John Ruskin produced 
"Kings Treasuries"; Swinburne 
And Rossetti still abused. 

Foetid Buchanan lifted up his voice 
When that faun's head of hers 
Became a pastime for 
Painters and adulterers. 

The Burne-Jones cartons 
Have preserved her eyes; 
Still, at the Tate, they teach 
Cophetua to rhapsodize; 

Thin like brook-water, 
With a vacant gaze. 
The English Rubaiyat was still-born 
In those days. 

The thin, clear gaze, the same 
Still darts out faun-like from the half-ruin'd face, 
Questing and passive .... 
"Ah, poor Jenny's case" ... 

Bewildered that a world 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Shows no surprise 
At her last maquero's 
Adulteries. 



"Siena Mi Fe', Disfecemi Maremma" 

Among the pickled foetuses and bottled bones, 
Engaged in perfecting the catalogue, 
I found the last scion of the 
Senatorial families of Strasbourg, Monsieur Verog. 

For two hours he talked of Gallifet; 
Of Dowson; of the Rhymers' Club; 
Told me how Johnson (Lionel) died 
By falling from a high stool in a pub ... 

But showed no trace of alcohol 
At the autopsy, privately performed -Tissue 
preserved -- the pure mind 
Arose toward Newman as the whiskey warmed. 

Dowson found harlots cheaper than hotels; 
Headlam for uplift; Image impartially imbued 
With raptures for Bacchus, Terpsichore and the Church. 
So spoke the author of "The Dorian Mood", 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

M. Verog, out of step with the decade, 
Detached from his contemporaries, 
Neglected by the young, 
Because of these reveries. 
Brennbaum. 

The sky-like limpid eyes, 
The circular infant's face, 
The stiffness from spats to collar 
Never relaxing into grace; 

The heavy memories of Horeb, Sinai and the forty years, 
Showed only when the daylight fell 
Level across the face 
Of Brennbaum "The Impeccable". 

Mr. Nixon 



In the cream gilded cabin of his steam yacht 
Mr. Nixon advised me kindly, to advance with fewer 
Dangers of delay. "Consider 
Carefully the reviewer. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

"I was as poor as you are; 
"When I began I got, of course, 
"Advance on royalties, fifty at first", said Mr. Nixon, 
"Follow me, and take a column, 
"Even if you have to work free. 

"Butter reviewers. From fifty to three hundred 
"I rose in eighteen months; 
"The hardest nut I had to crack 
"Was Dr. Dundas. 

"I never mentioned a man but with the view 
"Of selling my own works. 
"The tip's a good one, as for literature 
"It gives no man a sinecure." 

And no one knows, at sight a masterpiece. 
And give up verse, my boy, 
There's nothing in it." 

* * * 

Likewise a friend of Bloughram's once advised me: 
Don't kick against the pricks, 
Accept opinion. The "Nineties" tried your game 
And died, there's nothing in it.

Beneath the sagging roof 
The stylist has taken shelter, 
Unpaid, uncelebrated, 
At last from the world's welter 

Nature receives him, 
With a placid and uneducated mistress 
He exercises his talents 



And the soil meets his distress. 

The haven from sophistications and contentions 
Leaks through its thatch; 
He offers succulent cooking; 
The door has a creaking latch. 

XI. 

"Conservatrix of Milésien" 
Habits of mind and feeling, 
Possibly. But in Ealing 
With the most bank-clerkly of Englishmen? 

No, "Milésian" is an exaggeration. 
No instinct has survived in her 
Older than those her grandmother 
Told her would fit her station.

"Daphne with her thighs in bark 
Stretches toward me her leafy hands", -Subjectively. 
In the stuffed-satin drawing-room 
I await The Lady Valentine's commands, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Knowing my coat has never been 
Of precisely the fashion 
To stimulate, in her, 
A durable passion; 

Doubtful, somewhat, of the value 
Of well-gowned approbation 
Of literary effort, 
But never of The Lady Valentine's vocation: 

Poetry, her border of ideas, 
The edge, uncertain, but a means of blending 
With other strata 
Where the lower and higher have ending; 

A hook to catch the Lady Jane's attention, 



A modulation toward the theatre, 
Also, in the case of revolution, 
A possible friend and comforter.

Conduct, on the other hand, the soul 
"Which the highest cultures have nourished"

Dr. Johnson flourished;

Long since superseded the cultivation 
Of Pierian roses. 




Image From D'Orleans 

Young men riding in the street 
In the bright new season 
Spur without reason 
Causing their steeds to leap. 

And at the pace they keep 
Their horses' armoured feet 
Strike sparks from the cobbled street 
In the bright new season. 




Impressions Of Francois-Marie Arouet (De Voltaire) 

I 
Phyllidula and the Spoils of Gouvernet 

Where, Lady, are the days 
When you could go out in a hired hansom 
Without footmen and equipments? 
And dine in a soggy, cheap restaurant? 
Phyllidula now, with your powdered Swiss footman 
Clanking the door shut, 
and lying; 
And carpets from Savonnier, and from Persia, 
And your new service at dinner, 
And plates from Germain, 
And cabinets and chests from Martin (almost lacquer), 
And your white vases from Japan, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the lustre of diamonds, 
Etcetera, etcetera, and etcetera? 

II 
To Madame du Châtelet 

If you'd have me go on loving you 
Give me back the time of the thing. 

Will you give me dawn light at evening? 
Time has driven me out from the fine plaisaunces, 

The parks with the swards all over dew, 
And grass going glassy with the light on it, 
The green stretches where love is and the grapes 
Hang in yellow-white and dark clusters ready for pressing. 
And if now we can't fit with our time of life 
There is not much but its evil left us. 

Life gives us two minutes, two seasons 
One to be dull in; 
Two deaths and to stop loving and being lovable, 
That is the real death, 
The other is little beside it. 



Crying after the follies gone by me, 
Quiet talking is all that is left us 
Gentle talking, not like the first talking, less lively; 
And to follow after friendship, as they call it, 
Weeping that we can follow naught else. 

III 
To Madame Lullin 

You'll wonder that an old man of eighty 
Can go on writing you verses. . . . 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Grass showing under the snow, 
Birds singing late in the year! 

And Tibullus could say of his death, in his Latin: 
'Delia, I would look on you, dying.' 

And Delia herself fading out, 
Forgetting even her beauty. 




In A Station Of The Metro 

The apparition of these faces in the crowd; 
petals on a wet, black bough. 




In Durance 

(1907) 
1 am homesick after mine own kind, 
Oh I know that there are folk about me, friendly faces, 
But I am homesick after mine own kind. 

'These sell our pictures'! Oh well, 
They reach me not, touch me some edge or that, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But reach me not and all my life's become 
One flame, that reaches not beyond 
My heart's own hearth, 
Or hides among the ashes there for thee. 
Thee'? Oh, 'Thee' is who cometh first 
Out of mine own soul-kin, 
For I am homesick after mine own kind 
And ordinary people touch me not. 
And I am homesick 
After mine own kind that know, and feel 
And have some breath for beauty and the arts. 

Aye, I am wistful for my kin of the spirit 
And have none about me save in the shadows 
When come they, surging of power, 'DAEMON,' 
'Quasi KALOUN.' S.T. says Beauty is most that, a 
'calling to the soul'. 
Well then, so call they, the swirlers out of the mist of my soul, 
They that come mewards, bearing old magic. 

But for all that, I am homesick after mine own kind 
And would meet kindred even as I am, 
Flesh-shrouded bearing the secret. 
'All they that with strange sadness' 
Have the earth in mockery, and are kind to all, 
My fellows, aye I know the glory 
Of th' unbounded ones, but ye, that hide 
As I hide most the while 
And burst forth to the windows only whiles or whiles 
For love, or hope or beauty or for power, 
Then smoulder, with the lids half closed 
And are untouched by echoes of the world. 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Oh ye, my fellows: with the seas between us some be, 
Purple and sapphire for the silver shafts 
Of sun and spray all shattered at the bows; 
And some the hills hold off, 
The little hills to east of us, though here we 
Have damp and plain to be our shutting in. 

And yet my soul sings ‘Up!' and we are one. 
Yea thou, and Thou, and THOU, and all my kin 
To whom my breast and arms are ever warm, 
For that I love ye as the wind the trees 
That holds their blossoms and their leaves in cure 
And calls the utmost singing from the boughs 
That Hhout him, save the aspen, were as dumb 
Still shade, and bade no whisper speak the birds of how 
'Beyond, beyond, beyond, there lies . . .' 




In Exitum Cuiusdam 

On a certain one's departure 

‘Time's bitter flood'! Oh, that's all very well, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But where's the old friend hasn't fallen off, 
Or slacked his hand-grip when you first gripped fame? 
I know your circle and can fairly tell 
What you have kept and what you’ve left behind: 
I know my circle and know very well 
How many faces I'd have out of mind. 




In Tempore Senectutis 

When I am old 
I will not have you look apart 
From me, into the cold, 
Friend of my heart, 
Nor be sad in your remembrance 
Of the careless, mad-heart semblance 
That the wind hath blown away 
When I am old. 

When I am old 
And the white hot wonder-fire 
Unto the world seem cold, 
My soul's desire 
Know you then that all life's shower, 
The rain of the years, that hour 
Shall make blow for us one flower, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Including all, when we are old. 

When I am old 
If you remember 
Any love save what is then 
Hearth light unto life's December 
Be your joy of past sweet chalices 
To know then naught but this 
"How many wonders are less sweet 
Than love I bear to thee 
When I am old." 




In The Old Age Of The Soul 

I do not choose to dream; there cometh on me 
Some strange old lust for deeds. 
As to the nerveless hand of some old warrior 
The sword-hilt or the war-worn wonted helmet 
Brings momentary life and long-fled cunning, 
So to my soul grown old Grown 
old with many a jousting, many a foray, 
Grown old with namy a hither-coming and hence-going Till 
now they send him dreams and no more deed; 
So doth he flame again with might for action, 
Forgetful of the council of elders, 
Forgetful that who rules doth no more battle, 
Forgetful that such might no more cleaves to him 
So doth he flame again toward valiant doing. 




Invern 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Earth's winter cometh 
And I being part of all 
And sith the spirit of all moveth in me 
I must needs bear earth's winter 
Drawn cold and grey with hours 
And joying in a momentary sun, 
Lo I am withered with waiting till my spring cometh! 
Or crouch covetous of warmth 
O'er scant-logged ingle blaze, 
Must take cramped joy in tomed Longinus 
That, read I him first time 
The woods agleam with summer 
Or mid desirous winds of spring, 
Had set me singing spheres 
Or made heart to wander forth among warm roses 
Or curl in grass next neath a kindly moon. 




Ione, Dead The Long Year 

Empty are the ways, 
Empty are the ways of this land 
And the flowers 
Bend over with heavy heads. 
They bend in vain. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Empty are the ways of this land 
Where Ione 
Walked once, and now does not walk 
But seems like a person just gone. 




Ité 

Go, my songs, seek your praise from the young 
and from the intolerant, 
Move among the lovers of perfection alone. 
Seek ever to stand in the hard Sophoclean light 
And take you wounds from it gladly. 




La Fraisne 

For I was a gaunt, grave councillor 
Being in all things wise, and very old, 
But I have put aside this folly and the cold 
That old age weareth for a cloak. 

I was quite strong-at least they said so-
The young men at the sword-play; 
But I have put aside this folly, being gay 
In another fashion that more suiteth me. 

I have curled 'mid the boles of the ash wood, 
I have hidden my face where the oak 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Spread his leaves over me, and the yoke 
Of the old ways of men have I cast aside. 

By the still pool of Mar-nan-otha 
Have I found me a bride 
That was a dog-wood tree some syne. 
She hath called me from mine old ways 
She hath hushed my rancour of council, 
Bidding me praise 

Naught but the wind that flutters in the leaves. 

She hath drawn me from mine old ways, 
Till men say that I am mad; 
But I have seen the sorrow of men, and am glad, 
For I know that the wailing and bitterness are a folly. 

And I? I have put aside all folly and all grief. 
I wrapped my tears in an ellum leaf 
And left them under a stone 
And now men call me mad because I have thrown 
All folly from me, putting it aside 
To leave the old barren ways of men, 
Because my bride 
Is a pool of the wood, and 
Though all men say that I am mad 
It is only that I am glad, 



Very glad, for my bride hath toward me a great love 
That is sweeter than the love of women 
That plague and burn and drive one away. 

Aie-e! 'Tis true that I am gay 
Quite gay, for I have her alone here 
And no man troubleth us. 

Once when I was among the young men . . . 
And they said I was quite strong, among the young men. 
Once there was a woman . . . 
. . . but I forget . . . she was . . 
... I hope she will not come again. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
... I do not remember….. 

I think she hurt me once, but . . . 
That was very long ago. 

I do not like to remember things any more. 

I like one little band of winds that blow 
In the ash trees here: 
For we are quite alone 
Here 'mid the ash trees. 




La Regina Avrillouse 

Lady of rich allure, 
Queen of the spring's embrace, 
Your arms are long like boughs of ash, 
Mid laugh-broken streams, spirit of rain unsure, 
Breath of the poppy flower, 
All the wood thy bower 
And the hills thy dwelling-place. 

This will I no more dream; 
Warm is thy arm's allure, 
Warm is the gust of breath 
That ere thy lips meet mine 
Kisseth my cheek and saith: 
"This is the joy of earth, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Here is the wine of mirth 
Drain ye one goblet sure, 

Take ye the honey cup 
The honied song raise up, 
Drink of the spring's allure, 
April and dew and rain; 
Brown of the earth sing sure, 
Cheeks and lips and hair 
And soft breath that kisseth where 
Thy lips have come not yet to drink." 

Moss and the mold of earth, 
These be thy couch of mirth, 
Long arms thy boughs of shade 
April-alluring, as the blade 
Of grass doth catch the dew 
And make it crown to hold the sun. 
Banner be you 
Above my head, 
Glory to all wold display'd, 
April-alluring, glory-bold.

Ladies 

Agathas 
Four and forty lovers had Agathas in the old days, 
All of whom she refused; 
And now she turns to me seeking love, 
And her hair also is turning. 

Young Lady 
I have fed your lar with poppies, 
I have adored you for three full years; 
And now you grumble because your dress does not fit 
And because I happen to say so. 

Lesbia Illa 
Memnon, Menmon, that lady 
Who used to walk about amongst us 
With such gracious uncertainty, 
Is now wedded 
To a British householder. 
Lugete, Veneres! Lugete, Cupidinesque ! 

Passing 
Flawless as Aphrodite, 
Thoroughly beautiful, 
Brainless, 
The faint odour of your patchouli, 
Faint, almost, as the lines of cruelty about your chin, 
Assails me, and concerns me almost as little.

Lament Of The Frontier Guard 

By the North Gate, the wind blows full of sand, 
Lonely from the beginning of time until now! 
Trees fall, the grass goes yellow with autumn. 
I climb the towers and towers 
to watch out the barbarous land: 
Desolate castle, the sky, the wide desert. 
There is no wall left to this village. 
Bones white with a thousand frosts, 
High heaps, covered with trees and grass; 
Who brought this to pass? 
Who has brought the flaming imperial anger? 
Who has brought the army with drums and with kettle-drums? 
Barbarous kings. 
A gracious spring, turned to blood-ravenous autumn, 
A turmoil of wars - men, spread over the middle kingdom, 
Three hundred and sixty thousand, 
And sorrow, sorrow like rain. 
Sorrow to go, and sorrow, sorrow returning, 
Desolate, desolate fields, 
And no children of warfare upon them, 
No longer the men for offence and defence. 
Ah, how shall you know the dreary sorrow at the North Gate, 
With Rihoku's name forgotten, 
And we guardsmen fed to the tigers. 

By Rihaku. [Li Po?]

O plasmatour and true celestial light,

And day comes on.

And the birds repeat 
Their new song in the leaves.

‘Tis meet 
A man go where he will. 

But from where my heart is set 
No message I get; 
My heart all wakes and grieves; 
Defeat 
Or luck, I must have my fill. 

Our love comes out 
Like the branch that turns about 
On the top of the hawthorne, 
With frost and hail at night 
Suffers despite 
'Till the sun come, and the green leaf on the bough. 

I remember the young day 
When we set strife away, 
And she gave me such gesning, 
Her love and her ring: 
God grant I die not by any man's stroke 
'Till I have my hand 'neath her cloak. 

I care not for their clamour 



Who have come between me and my charmer, 
For I know how words run loose, 
Big talk and little use. 
Spoilers of pleasure, 
We take their measure.

Descant on a Theme by Cerclamon 

When the sweet air goes bitter, 
And the cold birds twitter 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Where the leaf falls from the twig, 
I sough and sing 

that Love goes out 
Leaving me no power to hold him. 

Of love I have naught 
Save trouble and sad thought, 
And nothing is grievous 
as I desirous, 
Wanting only what 
No man can get or has got. 

With the noblest that stands in men's sight, 
If all the world be in despite 
I care not a glove. 
Where my love is, there is a glitter of sun; 
God give me life, and let my course run 

'Till I have her I love 
To lie with and prove. 

I do not live, nor cure me, 
Nor feel my ache great as it is, 
For love will give 
me no respite, 
Nor do I know when I turn left or right 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
nor when I go out. 

For in her is all my delight 



And all that can save me. 

I shake and burn and quiver 
From love, awake and in swevyn, 
Such fear I have she deliver 
me not from pain, 
Who know not how to ask her; 
Who can not. 
Two years, three years I seek 
And though I fear to speak out, 
Still she must know it. 

If she won't have me now, Death is my portion, 
Would I had died that day 
I came into her sway. 
God! How softly this kills! 
When her love look steals on me. 
Killed me she has, I know not how it was, 
For I would not look on a woman. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Joy I have none, if she make me not mad 
Or set me quiet, or bid me chatter. 
Good is it to me if she flout 
Or turn me inside out, and about. 
My ill doth she turn sweet. 

How swift it is. 
For I am traist and loose, 
I am true, or a liar, 
All vile, or all gentle, 
Or shaking between, 
as she desire, 
I, Cerclamon, sorry and glad, 
The man whom love had 
and has ever; 
Alas! who'er it please or pain, 
She can me retain. 
I am gone from one joy, 
From one I loved never so much, 
She by one touch 
Reft me away; 
So doth bewilder me 



I can not say my say 
nor my desire, 
And when she looks on me 
It seems to me 
I lose all wit and sense. 

The noblest girls men love 
'Gainst her I prize not as a glove 
Worn and old. 
Though the whole world run rack 
And go dark with cloud, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Light is 
Where she stands, 
And a clamour loud 
in my ears.

Vergier 

In orchard under the hawthorne 
She has her lover till morn, 
Till the traist man cry out to warn 
Them God how swift the night, 
And day comes on. 

O Plasmatour, that thou end not the night, 
Nor take my beloved from my sight, 
Nor I, nor tower-man, look on daylight, 
'Fore God, How swift the night, 
And day comes on. 

'Lovely thou art, to hold me close and kisst, 
Now cry the birds out, in the meadow mist, 
Despite the cuckold, do thou as thou list, 
So swiftly goes the night 
And day comes on. 

‘My pretty boy, make we our play again 
Here in the orchard where the birds complain, 
'Till the traist watcher his song unrein, 
Ah God! How swift the night 
And day comes on.' 



‘Out of the wind that blows from her, 
That dancing and gentle is and thereby pleasanter, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Have I drunk a draught, sweeter than scent of myrrh. 
Ah God! How swift the night. 
And day comes on.' 

Venust the lady, and none lovelier, 
For her great beauty, many men look on her, 
Out ofmy love will her heart not stir. 
By God, how swift the night. 
And day comes on.

Leave-Taking Near Shoku 

They say the roads of Sanso are steep, 
Sheer as the mountains. 
The walls rise in a man's face, 
Clouds grow out of the hill 
at his horse's bridle. 
Sweet trees are on the paved way of the Shin, 
Their trunks burst through the paving, 
And freshets are bursting their ice 
in the midst of Shoku, a proud city. 
Men's fates are already set, 
There is no need of asking diviners.

Les Millwin 

The little Millwins attend the Russian Ballet. 
The mauve and greenish souls of the little Millwins 
Were seen lying along the upper seats 
Like so many unused boas. 

The turbulent and undisciplined host of art students-
The rigorous deputation from ‘Slade’Was 
before them. 

With arms exalted, with fore-arms 
Crossed in great futuristic X's, the art students 
Exulted, they beheld the splendours of Cleopatra 

And the little Millwins beheld these things; 
With their large and anaemic eyes they looked out upon 
this configuration. 

Let us therefore mention the fact, 
For it seems to us worthy of record.

‘Tis of my country that I would endite, 
In hope to set some misconceptions right. 
My country? I love it well, and those good fellows 
Who, since their wit's unknown, escape the gallows. 
But you stuffed coats who're neither tepid nor distinctly boreal, 
Pimping, conceited, placid, editorial, 
Could I but speak as 'twere in the 'Restoration' 
I would articulate your perdamnation. 
This year perforce I must with circumspection 
For Mencken states somewhere, in this connection: 
‘It is a moral nation we infest.' 
Despite such reins and checks I'll do my best, 
An art! You all respect the arts, from that infant tick 
Who's now the editor of The Altantic, 
From Comstock's self, down to the meanest resident, 
Till up again, right up, we reach the president, 
Who shows his taste in his ambassadors: 
A novelist, a publisher, to pay old scores, 
A novelist, a publisher and a preacher, 
That's sent to Holland, a most particular feature, 
Henry Van Dyke, who thinks to charm the Muse you pack her in 
A sort of stinking deliquescent saccharine. 
The constitution of our land, O Socrates, 
Was made to incubate such mediocrities, 
These and a state in books that's grown perennial 
And antedates the Philadelphia centennial. 
Still I'd respect you more if you could bury 
Mabie, and Lyman Abbot and George Woodberry, 
For minds so wholly founded upon quotations 
Are not the best of pulse for infant nations. 
Dulness herself, that abject spirit, chortles 
To see your forty self-baptized immortals, 
And holds her sides where swelling laughter cracks 'em 
Before the 6Ars Poetica' of Hiram Maxim. 
All one can say of this refining medium 
Is cZut! Cinque lettres!' a banished gallic idiom, 
Their doddering ignorance is waxed so notable 
'Tis time that it was capped with something quotable. 



Here Radway grew, the fruit of pantosocracy, 
The very fairest flower of their gynocracy. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Radway ? My hero, for it will be more inspiring 
If I set forth a bawdy plot like Byron 
Than if I treat the nation as a whole. 
Radway grew up. These forces shaped his soul; 
These, and yet God, and Dr. Parkhurst's god, the N.Y. Journal 
(Which pays him more per week than The Supernal). 
These and another godlet of that day, your day 
(You feed a hen on grease, perhaps she'll lay 
The sterile egg that is still eatable: 
'Prolific Noyes' with output undefeatable). 
From these he (Radway) learnt, from provosts and from editors unyielding 
And innocent of Stendhal, Flaubert, Maupassant and Fielding. 
They set their mind (it's still in that condition) 
May we repeat; the Centennial Exposition 
At Philadelphia, 1876? 
What it knew then, it knows, and there it sticks. 
And yet another, a 'charming man', ‘sweet nature,' but was Gilder, 
De mortuis verum, truly the master builder? 

From these he learnt. Poe, Whitman, Whistler, men, their recognition 
Was got abroad, what better luck do you wish 'em, 
When writing well has not yet been forgiven 
In Boston, to Henry James, the greatest whom we've seen living. 
And timorous love of the innocuous 
Brought from Gt. Britain and dumped down a'top of us, 
Till you may take your choice: to feel the edge of satire or 
Read Bennett or some other flaccid flatterer. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Despite it all, despite your Red Bloods, febrile concupiscence 
Whose blubbering yowls you take for passion's essence; 
Despite it all, your compound predilection 
For ignorance, its growth and its protection 
(Vide the tariff), I will hang simple facts 
Upon a tale, to combat other tracts, 
'Message to Garcia,' Mosher's propagandas 
That are the nation's botts, collicks and glanders. 
Or from the feats of Sumner cull it? Think, 
Could Freud or Jung'unfathom such a sink? 

My hero, Radway, I have named, in truth, 
Some forces among those which 'formed' his youth: 



These heavy weights, these dodgers and these preachers, 
Crusaders, lecturers and secret lechers, 
Who wrought about his 'soul' their stale infection. 
These are the high-brows, and to this collection 
The social itch, the almost, all but, not quite, fascinating, 
Piquante, delicious, luscious, captivating: 
Puffed satin, and silk stockings, where the knee 
Clings to the skirt in strict (vide: 'Vogue') propriety. 
Three thousand chorus girls and all unkissed, 
state sans song, sans home-grown wine, sans realist! 
'Tell me not in mournful wish-wash 
Life's a sort of sugared dish-wash!' 
Radway had read the various evening papers 
And yearned to imitate the Waldorf capers 
As held before him in that unsullied mirror 
The daily press, and monthlies nine cents dearer. 
They held the very marrow of the ideals 
That fed his spirit; were his mental meals. 
Also, he'd read of Christian virtues in 
That canting rag called Everybody's Magazine, 
And heard a clergy that tries on more wheezes 
Than e'er were heard of by Our Lord Ch . . . . J 
So he 'faced life' with rather mixed intentions, 
He had attended country Christian Endeavour Conventions, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Where one gets more chances 
Than Spanish ladies had in old romances. 
(Let him rebuke who ne'er has known the pure Platonic grapple, 
Or hugged two girls at once behind a chapel.) 
Such practices diluted rural boredom 
Though some approved of them, and some deplored 'em. 
Such was he when he got his mother's letter 
And would not think a thing that could upset her. . . . 
Yet saw an ad.' To-night, THE HUDSON SAIL, 
With forty queens, and music to regale 
The select company: beauties you all would know 
By name, if named.' So it was phrased, or rather somewhat so 
I have mislaid the ‘ad.', but note the touch, 
Note, reader, note the sentimental touch: 
His mother's birthday gift. (How pitiful 
That only sentimental stuff will sell!) 

Yet Radway went. A circumspectious prig! 



And then that woman like a guinea-pig 
Accosted, that's the word, accosted him, 
Thereon the amorous calor slightly frosted him. 
(I burn, I freeze, I sweat, said the fair Greek, 
I speak in contradictions, so to speak.) 

I've told his training, he was never bashful, 
And his pockets by ma's aid, that night with cash full, 
The invitation had no need of fine aesthetic, 
Nor did disgust prove such a strong emetic 
That we, with Masefield's vein, in the next sentence 
Record ‘Odd's blood! Ouch! Ouch!' a prayer, his swift repentance. 
No, no, they danced. The music grew much louder 
As he inhaled the 'still fumes of rice-powder. 
Then there came other nights, came slow but certain 
And were such nights that we should 'draw the curtain' 
In writing fiction on uncertain chances 
Of publication; 'Circumstances,' 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
As the editor of The Century says in print, 
'Compel a certain silence and restraint.' 
Still we will bring our 'fiction as near to fact' as 
The Sunday school brings virtues into practice. 

Soon our hero could manage once a week, 
Not that his pay had risen, and no leak 
Was found in his employer's cash. He learned the lay of cheaper places, 
And then Radway began to go the paces: 
A rosy path, a sort of vernal ingress, 
And Truth should here be careful of her thin dress 
Though males of seventy, who fear truths naked harm us, 
Must think Truth looks as they do in wool pyjamas. 
(My country, I've said your morals and your thoughts are stale ones, 
But surely the worst of your old-women are the male ones.) 

Why paint these days? An insurance inspector 
For fires and odd risks, could in this sector 
Furnish more data for a compilation 
Than I can from this distant land and station, 
Unless perhaps I should have recourse to 
One of those firm-faced inspecting women, who 
Find pretty Irish girls in Chinese laundries, 
Up stairs, the third floor up, and have such quandaries 



As to how and why and whereby they got in 
And for what earthly reason they remain. . . . 
Alas, eheu, one question that sorely vexes 
The serious social folk is ‘just what sex is'. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Though it will, of course, pass off with social science 
In which their mentors place such wide reliance . . 
De Gourmont says that fifty grunts are all that will be prized. 
Of langauge, by men wholly socialized, 
With signs as many, that shall represent 'em 
When thoroughly socialized printers want to print 'em. 
‘As free of mobs as kings'? I'd have men free of that invidious, 
Lurking, serpentine, amphibious and insidious 
Power that compels 'em 
To be so much alike that every dog that smells 'em, 
Thinks one identity is 
Smeared o'er the lot in equal quantities. 
Still we look toward the day when man, with unction, 
Will long only to be a social function, 
And even Zeus' wild lightning fear to strike 
Lest it should fail to treat all men alike. 
And I can hear an old man saying: ‘Oh, the rub!’ 
I see them sitting in the Harvard Club, 
'And rate 'em up at just so much per head, 
'Till I have viewed straw hats and their habitual clothing 
'All the same style, same cut, with perfect loathing.' 

So Radway walked, quite like the other men, 
Out into the crepuscular half-light, now and then; 
Saw what the city offered, cast an eye 
Upon Manhattan's gorgeous panoply, 
The flood of limbs upon Eighth Avenue 
To beat Prague, Budapesth, Vienna or Moscow, 
Such animal invigorating carriage 
As nothing can restrain or much disparage. . . . 
Still he was not given up to brute enjoyment, 
An anxious sentiment was his employment, 
For memory of the first warm night still cast a haze o'er 
The mind of Radway, whene'er he found a pair of purple stays or 
Some other quaint reminder of the occasion 
That first made him believe in immoral suasion. 
A temperate man, a thin potationist, each day 
A silent hunter off the Great White Way, 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

He read The Century and thought it nice 
To be not too well known in haunts of vice 
The prominent haunts, where one might recognize him, 
And in his daily walks duly capsize him. 
Thus he eschewed the bright red-walled cafes and 
Was never one of whom one speaks as ‘brazen'd'. 

Some men will live as prudes in their own village 
And make the tour abroad for their wild tillage 
I knew a tourist agent, one whose art is 
To run such tours. He calls 'em. . . . house parties. 
But Radway was a patriot whose venality 
Was purer in its love of one locality, 
A home-industrious worker to perfection, 
A sensational jobber for protection, 
Especially on books, lest knowledge break in 
Upon the national brains and set 'em achin'. 
'Tis an anomaly in our large land of freedom, 
You can not get cheap books, even if you need 'em.) 
Radway was ignorant as an editor, 
And, heavenly, holy gods! I can't say more, 
Though I know one, a very base detractor, 
Who has the phrase ‘As ignorant as an actor,' 
But turn to Radway: the first night on the river, 
Running so close to ‘hell’ it sends a shiver 
Down Rodyheaver's prophylactic spine, 
Let me return to this bold theme of mine, 
Of Radway. O clap hand ye moralists! 
And meditate upon the Lord's conquests. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
When last I met him, he was a pillar in 
An organization for the suppression of sin. . . . 
Not that he'd changed his tastes, nor yet his habits, 
(Such changes don't occur in men, or rabbits). 
Not that he was a saint, nor was top-loftical 
In spiritual aspirations, but he found it profitable, 
For as Ben Franklin said, with such urbanity: 
'Nothing will pay thee, friend, like Christianity.' 
And in our day thus saith the Evangelist: 
'Tent preachin' is the kind that pays the best.' 

'Twas as a business asset pure an’ simple 
That Radway joined the Baptist Broadway Temple. 



I find no moral for a peroration, 
He is the prototype of half the nation.

Marvoil 

A poor clerk I, 'Arnaut the less' they call me, 
And because I have small mind to sit 
Day long, long day cooped on a stool 
A-jumbling o' figures for Maitre Jacques Polin, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I ha' taken to rambling the South here. 

The Vicomte of Beziers's not such a bad lot. 
I made rimes to his lady this three year: 
Vers and canzone, till that damn'd son of Aragon, 
Alfonso the half-bald, took to hanging 
His helmet at Beziers. 
Then came what might come, to wit: three men and one woman, 
Beziers off at Mont-Ausier, I and his lady 
Singing the stars in the turrets of Beziers, 
And one lean Aragonese cursing the seneschal 
To the end that you see, friends: 

Aragon cursing in Aragon, Beziers busy at Beziers 
Bored to an inch of extinction, 
Tibors all tongue and temper at Mont-Ausier, 
Me! in this damn'd inn of Avignon, 
Stringing long verse for the Burlatz; 
All for one half-bald, knock-knee'd king of the Aragonese, 
Alfonso, Quattro, poke-nose. 

And if when I am dead 
They take the trouble to tear out this wall here, 
They'11 know more of Arnaut of Marvoil 
Than half his canzoni say of him. 
As for will and testament I leave none, 
Save this: ‘Vers and canzone to the Countess of Beziers 
In return for the first kiss she gave me.' 
May her eyes and her cheek be fair 
To all men except the King of Aragon, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And may I come'speedily to Beziers 
Whither my desire and my dream have preceded me. 

O hole in the wall here! be thou my jongleur 
As ne'er had I other, and when the wind blows, 



Sing thou the grace of the Lady of Beziers, 
For even as thou art hollow before I fill thee with this parchment, 
So is my heart hollow when she filleth not mine eyes, 
And so were my mind hollow, did she not fill utterly my thought. 

Wherefore, O hole in the wall here, 
When the wind blows sigh thou for my sorrow 
That I have not the Countess of Beziers 
Close in my arms here. 
Even as thou shalt soon have this parchment. 

O hole in the wall here, be thou my jongleur, 
And though thou sighest my sorrow in the wind, 
Keep yet my secret in thy breast here; 
Even as I keep her image in my heart here. 




Masks 

These tales of old disguisings, are they not 
Strange myths of souls that found themselves among 
Unwonted folk that spake an hostile tongue, 
Some soul from all the rest who'd not forgot 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The star-span acres of a former lot 
Where boundless mid the clouds his course he swung, 
Or carnate with his elder brothers sung 
Ere ballad-makers lisped of Camelot? 

Old singers half-forgetful of their tunes, 
Old painters color-blind come back once more, 
Old poets skill-less in the wind-heart runes, 
Old wizards lacking in their wonder-lore: 

All they that with strange sadness in their eyes 
Ponder in silence o'er earth's queynt devyse?

Drifted on

Unable in the supervening blankness 
To sift TO AGATHON from the chaff 
Until he found his sieve . . . 
Ultimately, his seismograph: 

Given that is his 'fundamental passion', 
This urge to convey the relation 
Of eye-lid and cheek-bone 
By verbal manifestations; 
To present the series 
Of curious heads in medallion 

He had passed, inconscient, full gaze, 
The wide-branded irides 
And botticellian sprays implied 
In their diastasis; 

Which ansethesis, noted a year late, 
And weighed, revealed his great affect, 
(Orchid), mandate 
Of Eros, a retrospect. 

Mouths biting empty air, 
The still stone dogs, 
Caught in metamorphosis, were 
Left him as epilogues.

Honey-red, closing the face-oval, 
A basket-work of braids which seem as if they were 
Spun in King Minos' hall 
From metal, or intractable amber; 

The face-oval beneath the glaze, 
Bright in its suave bounding-line, as, 
Beneath half-watt rays, 
The eyes turn topaz.

Words that were wing'd as her sparks in eruption, 
Eagled and thundered as Jupiter Pluvius, 
Sound in your wind past all signs o' corruption. 

Here's to you, Old Hippety-Hop o' the accents, 
True to the Truth's sake and crafty dissector, 
You grabbed at the gold sure; had no need to pack cents, 
Into your versicles.

Middle-Aged 

‘Tis but a vague, invarious delight 
As gold that rains about some buried king. 

As the fine flakes, 
When tourists frolicking 
Stamp on his roof or in the glazing light 
Try photographs, wolf down their ale and cakes 
And start to inspect some further pyramid; 

As the fine dust, in the hid cell 
Beneath their transitory step and merriment, 
Drifts through the air, and the sarcophagus 
Gains yet another crust 
Of useless riches for the occupant, 
So I, the fires that lit once dreams 
Now over and spent, 
Lie dead within four walls 
And so now love 
Rains down and so enriches some stiff case, 
And strews a mind with precious metaphors, 

And so the space 
Of my still consciousness 
Is full of gilded snow, 

The which, no cat has eyes enough 
To see the brightness of.

A 'blue' and a climber of mountains, has married at the age of 28, 
He being at that age a virgin,

And even now Mr. Styrax 
Does not believe in asthetics.

With a distaste for caresses.

And no issue presents itself. 
She does not desire her children, 
Or any more children. 
Her ambition is vague and indefinite, 
She will neither stay in, nor come out.

A.t a friend of my wife's there is a photograph, 
A faded, pale brownish photograph, 
Of the times when the sleeves were large, 
Silk, stiff and large above the lacertus, 
That is, the upper arm, 
And décolleté'. . . . 
It is a lady, 
She sits at a harp, 
Playing, 
And by her left foot, in a basket, 
Is an infant, aged about 14 months, 
The infant beams at the parent, 
The parent re-beams at its offspring. 
The basket is lined with satin,

There is a satin-like bow on the harp.

And in the home of the novelist 
There is a satin-like bow on an harp. 
You enter and pass hall after hall,

Lilies lift their white symbolical cups, 
Whence their symbolical pollen has been excerpted, 
Near them I noticed an harp 
And the blue satin ribbon, 
And the copy of 4Hatha Yoga' 
And the neat piles of unopened, unopening books, 

And she spoke to me of the monarch, 
And of the purity of her soul.

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And sticking out all the way round; 
Blagueur! 'Con gli occhi onesti e tardi,' 

And he said: 
‘0h! Abelard!' as if the topic 
Were much too abstruse for his comprehension, 
And he talked about 'the Great Mary', 
And said: ‘Mr. Pound is shocked at my levity.' 



When it turned out he meant Mrs. Ward. 

And the other was rather like my bust by Gaudier, 
Or like a real Texas colonel, 
He said: 'Why flay dead horses? 
'There was once a man called Voltaire.' 

And he said they used to cheer Verdi, 
In Rome, after the opera, 
And the guards couldn't stop them, 

And that was an anagram for Vittorio 
Emanuele Re D' Italia, 
And the guards couldn't stop them. 

Old men with beautiful manners, 
Sitting in the Row of a morning; 
Walking on the Chelsea Embankment.

Ritratto 

And she said: 
' You remember Mr. Lowell, 
'He was your ambassador here?' 
And I said: 'That was before I arrived.' 
And she said: 
'He stomped into my bedroom.… 
(By that time she had got on to Browning.) 
'. . . stomped into my bedroom. . . . 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
'And said: 'Do I, 
' 'I ask you, Do I 
' 'Care too much for society dinners?' 
'And I wouldn't say that he didn't. 
'Shelley used to live in this house.' 

She was a very old lady, 
I never saw her again. 




Monumentum Aere, Etc. 

You say that I take a good deal upon myself; 
That I strut in the robes of assumption. 

In a few years no one will remember the buffo, 
No one will remember the trivial parts of me, 
The comic detail will be absent. 
As for you, you will rot in the earth, 
And it is doubtful if even your manure will be rich 
enough 

To keep grass 
Over your grave.

Mr. Housman's Message 

O woe, woe, 
People are born and die, 
We also shall be dead pretty soon 
Therefore let us act as if we were 
dead already. 

The bird sits on the hawthorn tree 
But he dies also, presently. 
Some lads get hung, and some get shot. 
Woeful is this human lot. 
Woe! woe, etcetera. . . . 

London is a woeful place, 
Shropshire is much pleasanter. 
Then let us smile a little space 
Upon fond nature's morbid grace. 
Oh, Woe, woe, woe, etcetera. . . . 




Mr. Nixon 

In the cream gilded cabin of his steam yacht 
Mr. Nixon advised me kindly, to advance with fewer 
Dangers of delay. 'Consider 
Carefully the reviewer. 

'I was as poor as you are; 
'When I began I got, of course, 
'Advance on royalties, fifty at first,' said Mr. Nixon, 
'Follow me, and take a column, 
'Even if you have to work free. 

'Butter reviewers. From fifty to three hundred 
'I rose in eighteen months; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
'The hardest nut I had to crack 
'Was Dr. Dundas. 

'I never mentioned a man but with the view 
'Of selling my own works. 
'The tip's a good one, as for literature 
'It gives no man a sinecure. 

'And no one knows, at sight, a masterpiece. 
'And give up verse, my boy, 
'There's nothing in it.' 

Likewise a friend of Bloughram's once advised me: 
Don't kick against the pricks, 
Accept opinion. The 'Nineties' tried your game 
And died, there's nothing in it.

Beneath the sagging roof 
The stylist has taken shelter, 
Unpaid, uncelebrated, 
At last from the world's welter 

Nature receives him; 
With a placid and uneducated mistress 
He exercises his talents 



And the soil meets his distress. 

The haven from sophistications and contentions 
Leaks through its thatch; 
He offers succulent cooking; 
The door has a creaking latch.

Conservatrix of Milésien' 
Habits of mind and feeling, 
<|endoftext|>

Possibly. But in Ealing

No, 'Milésian' is an exaggeration. 
No instinct has survived in her

‘Daphne with her thighs in bark 
Stretches toward me her leafy hands,' 
Subjectively. In the stuffed-satin drawing-room 
I await The Lady Valentine's commands, 

Knowing my coat has never been 
Of precisely the fashion 
To stimulate, in her, 
A durable passion; 

Doubtful, somewhat, of the value 
Of well-gowned approbation 
Of literary effort, 
But never of The Lady Valentine's vocation: 

Poetry, her border of ideas, 
The edge, uncertain, but a means of blending 
With other strata 
Where the lower and higher have ending; 

A hook to catch the Lady Jane's attention, 
A modulation toward the theatre, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Also, in the case of revolution, 



A possible friend and comforter. 

Conduct, on the other hand, the soul 
‘Which the highest cultures have nourished' 
To Fleet St. where 
Dr. Johnson flourished; 

Beside this thoroughfare 
The sale of half-hose has 
Long since superseded the cultivation 
Of Pierian roses. 




N. Y. 
My City, my beloved, my white! Ah, slender, 
Listen! Listen to me, and I will breathe into thee a soul. 
Delicately upon the reed, attend me! 

Now do I know that I am mad, 
For here are a million people surly with traffic; 
This is no maid. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Neither could I play upon any reed if I had one. 

My City, my beloved, 
Thou art a maid with no breasts, 
Thou art slender as a silver reed. 
Listen to me, attend me! 
And I will breathe into thee a soul, 
And thou shalt live for ever. 




Na Audiart 

Though thou well dost wish me ill 
Audiart, Audiart, 
Where thy bodice laces start 
As ivy fingers clutching through 
Its crevices, 
Audiart, Audiart, 
Stately, tall and lovely tender 
Who shall render 
Audiart, Audiart, 
Praises meet unto thy fashion? 
Here a word kiss ! 
Pass I on 
Unto Lady ‘Miels-de-Ben’, 
Having praised thy girdle's scope 
How the stays ply back from it; 
I breath no hope 
That thou shouldst . . . 
Nay no whit 
Bespeak thyself for anything. 
Just a word in thy praise, girl, 
Just for the swirl 
Thy satins make upon the stair, 
'Cause never a flaw was there 
Where thy torse and limbs are met 
Though thou hate me, read it set 
In rose and gold. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Or when the minstrel, tale half told, 
Shall burst to lilting at the praise 
'Audiart, Audiart' . . 
Bertrans, master of his lays, 
Bertrans of Aultaforte thy praise 
Sets forth, and though thou hate me well, 
Yea though thou wish me ill, 
Audiart, Audiart. 
Thy loveliness is here writ till, 
Audiart, 
Oh, till thou come again. 
And being bent and wrinkled, in a form 
That hath no perfect limning, when the warm 



Youth dew is cold 
Upon thy hands, and thy old soul 
Scorning a new, wry'd casement, 
Churlish at seemed misplacement, 
Finds the earth as bitter 
As now seems it sweet, 
Being so young and fair 
As then only in dreams, 
Being then young and wry'd, 
Broken of ancient pride, 
Thou shalt then soften, 
Knowing, I know not how, 
Thou wert once she 
Audiart, Audiart 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
For whose fairness one forgave 
Audiart, 
Audiart 
Que be-m vols mal. 




National Song (E.C.) 

There is no land like England 
Where banks rise day by day, 
There are no banks like English banks 
To make the people pay. 

There is no such land of castles 
Where an Englishman is free 
To read his smutty literature 
With muffins at his tea. 

Chorus: 
For the French have comic papers 
Not that nice Britons read 'em, 
But the bawdy little Britons 
Have bank sharks to bleed 'em 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And to keep an eye on their readin' matter 
Lest they should overhear the distressing chatter 
Of the new economical theories 
And ask inconvenient queetfes. 




Near Perigord 

I 
You'd have men's hearts up from the dust 
And tell their secrets, Messire Cino, 
Rigkt enough? Then read between the lines of Uc St. Circ, 
Solve me the riddle, for you know the tale. 

Bertrans, En Bertrans, left a fine canzone: 
6Maent, I love you, you have turned me out. 
The voice at Montfort, Lady Agnes' hair, 
Bel Miral's stature, the viscountess' throat, 
Set all together, are not worthy of you. . . .' 
And all the while you sing out that canzone, 
Think you that Maent lived at Montaignac, 
One at Chalais, another at Malemort 
Hard over Brive for every lady a castle, 
Each place strong. 

Oh, is it easy enough? 
Tairiran held hall in Montaignac, 
His brother-in-law was all there was of power 
In Perigord, and this good union 
Gobbled all the land, and held it later for some hundred years. 
And our En Bertrans was in Altafort, 
Hub of the wheel, the stirrer-up of strife, 
As caught by Dante in the last wallow of hell 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The headless trunk 'that made its head a lamp', 
For separation wrought out separation, 
And he who set the strife between brother and brother 
And had his way with the old English king,, 
Viced in such torture for the 'counterpass'. 
How would you live, with neighbours set about you 
Poictiers and Brive, untaken Rochecouart, 
Spread like the finger-tips of one frail hand; 
And you on that great mountain of a palm 
Not a neat ledge, not Foix between its streams, 
But one huge back half-covered up with pine, 
Worked for and snatched from the string-purse of Born 
The four round towers, four brothers mostly fools 
What could he do but play the desperate chess, 



And stir old grudges? 
‘Pawn your castles, lords! 
Let the Jews pay.' 
And the great scene 
(That, maybe, never happened!) 
Beaten at last, 
Before the hard old king: 
'Your son, ah, since he died 
''My wit and worth are cobwebs brushed aside 
'In the full flare of grief. Do what you will.' 

Take the whole man, and ravel out the story. 
He loved this lady in castle Montaignac ? 
The castle flanked him he had need of it. 
You read to-day, how long the overlords of Perigord, 
The Talleyrands, have held the place; it was no transient fiction. 
And Maent failed him? Or saw through the scheme? 

And all his net-like thought of new alliance? 
Chalais is high, a-level with the poplars. 
Its lowest stones just meet the valley tips 
Where the low Dronne is filled with water-lilies. 
And Rochecouart can match it, stronger yet, 
The very spur's end, built on sheerest cliff, 
And Malemort keeps its close hold on Brive, 
While Born, his own close purse, his rabbit warren, 
His subterranean chamber with a dozen doors, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
A-bristle with antennae to feel roads, 
To sniff the traffic into Perigord. 
And that hard phalanx, that unbroken line, 
The ten good miles from there to Maent's castle, 
All of his flank how could he do without her? 
And all the road to Cahors, to Toulouse? 
would he do without her? 

‘Papiol, 
Go forthright singing Anhes, Cembelins. 
There is a throat; ah, there are two white hands; 
There is a trellis full of early roses, 
And all my heart is bound about with love. 
Where am I come with compound flatteries 
What doors are open to fine compliment?' 



And every one half jealous of Maent? 
He wrote the catch to pit their jealousies 
Against her; give her pride in them? 

Take his own speech, make what you will of it 
And still the knot, the first knot, of Maent? 

Is it a love poem? Did he sing of war? 
Is it an intrigue to run subtly out, 
Born of a jongleur's tongue, freely to pass 
Up and about and in and out the land, 
Mark him a craftsman and a strategist? 
(St. Leider had done as much as Polhonac, 
Singing a different stave, as closely hidden.) 
Oh, there is precedent, legal tradition, 
To sing one thing when your song means another, 
'Et albirar ab lor bordon ' 
Foix' count knew that. What is Sir Bertrans' singing? 
Maent, Maent, and yet again Maent, 
Or war and broken heaumes and politics? 

II 
End fact. Try fiction. Let us say we see 
En Bertrans, a tower-room at Hautefort, 
Sunset, the ribbon-like road lies, in red cross-light, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Southward toward Montaignac, and he bends at a table 
Scribbling, swearing between his teeth; by his left hand 
Lie little strips of parchment covered over, 
Scratched and erased with al and ochaisos. 
Testing his list of rhymes, a lean man? Bilious? 
With a red straggling beard? 
And the green cat's-eye lifts toward Montaignac. 

Or take his 'magnet' singer setting out, 
Dodging his way past Aubeterre, singing at Chalais 
In the vaulted hall, 
Or, by a lichened tree at Rochecouart 
Aimlessly watching a hawk above the valleys, 
Waiting his turn in the mid-summer evening, 
Thinking of Aelis, whom he loved heart and soul . . . 
To find her half alone, Montfort away, 
And a brown, placid, hated woman visiting her, 



Spoiling his visit, with a year before the next one. 
Little enough ? 
Or carry him forward. 'Go through all the courts, 
My Magnet,' Bertrans had said. 

We came to Ventadour 
In the mid love court, he sings out the canzon, 
No one hears save Arrimon Luc D'Esparo 
No one hears aught save the gracious sound of compliments. 
Sir Arrimon counts on his fingers, Montfort, 
Rochecouart, Chalais, the rest, the tactic, 
Malemort, guesses beneath, sends wrord to Cceur-de-Lion: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The compact, de Born smoked out, trees felled 
About his castle, cattle driven out! 
Or no one sees it, and En Bertrans prospered? 

And ten years after, or twenty, as you will, 
Arnaut and Richard lodge beneath Chalus: 
The dull round towers encroaching on the field, 
The tents tight drawn, horses at tether 
Further and out of reach, the purple night, 
The crackling of small fires, the bannerets, 
The lazy leopards on the largest banner, 
Stray gleams on hanging mail, an armourer's torch-flare 
Melting on steel. 

And in the quietest space 
They probe old scandals, say de Born is dead; 
And we've the gossip (skipped six hundred years). 
Richard shall die to-morrow leave him there 
Talking oftrobar clus with Daniel. 
And the 'best craftsman' sings out his friend's song, 
Envies its vigour . . . and deplores the technique, 
Dispraises his own skill? That's as you will. 
And they discuss the dead man, 
Plantagenet puts the riddle: 'Did he love her?' 
And Arnaut parries: 'Did he love your sister? 
True, he has praised her, but in some opinion 
He wrote that praise only to show he had 
The favour of your party; had been well received.' 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
'You knew the man.' 



‘You knew the man.' 
'I am an artist, you have tried both metiers.' 
'You were born near him.' 
'Do we know our friends?' 
'Say that he saw the castles, say that he loved Maent!' 
'Say that he loved her, does it solve the riddle?' 
End the discussion, Richard goes out next day 
And gets a quarrel-bolt shot through his vizard, 
Pardons the bowman, dies, , 

Ends our discussion. Arnaut ends 
‘In sacred odour' (that's apocryphal!) 
And we can leave the talk till Dante writes: 
Surely I saw, and still before my eyes 
Goes on that headless trunk, that bears for light 
Its own head swinging, gripped by the dead hair, 
And like a swinging lamp that says, 'Ah me! 
I severed men, my head and heart 
Ye see here severed, my life's counterpart.’ 
Or take En Bertrans? 

III 
Bewildering spring, and by the Auvezere 
Poppies and day's eyes in the green 6mail 
Rose over us; and we knew all that stream, 
And our two horses had traced out the valleys; 
Knew the low flooded lands squared out with poplars, 
In the young days when the deep sky befriended. 
And great wings beat above us in the twilight, 
And the great wheels in heaven 
Bore us together . . . surging . . . and apart . . . 
Believing we should meet with lips and hands, 

High, high and sure . . . and then the counter-thrust: 
‘Why do you love me? Will you always love me? 
But I am like the grass, I can not love you.' 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Or, ‘Love, and I love and love you, 
And hate your mind, not you, your soul, your hands.' 

So to this last estrangement, Tairiran! 

There shut; up in his castle, Tairiran's, 



She who had nor ears nor tongue save in her hands, 
Gone ah, gone untouched, unreachable ! 
She who could never live save through one person, 
She who could never speak save to one person, 
And all the rest of her a shifting change, 
A broken bundle of mirrors . . . ! 




Nicotine 

Hymn to the Dope 

Goddess of the murmuring courts, 
Nicotine, my Nicotine, 
Houri of the mystic sports, 
trailing-robed in gabardine, 
Gliding where the breath hath glided, 
Hidden sylph of filmy veils, 
Truth behind the dream is veiléd 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
E'en as thou art, smiling ever, ever gliding, 
Wraith of wraiths, dim lights dividing 
Purple, grey, and shadow green 
Goddess, Dream-grace, Nicotine. 

Goddess of the shadow's lights, 
Nicotine, my Nicotine, 
Some would set old Earth to rights, 
Thou I none such ween. 
Veils of shade our dream dividing, 
Houris dancing, intergliding, 
Wraith of wraiths and dream of faces, 
Silent guardian of the old unhallowed places, 
Utter symbol of all old sweet druidings, 
Mem'ry of witched wold and green, 
Nicotine, my Nicotine: 

Neath the shadows of thy weaving 
Dreams that need no undeceiving, 
Loves that longer hold me not, 
Dreams I dream not any more, 
Fragrance of old sweet forgotten places, 
Smiles of dream-lit, flit-by faces 
All as perfume Arab-sweet 
Deck the high road to thy feet 

As were Godiva's coming fated 
And all the April's blush belated 
Were lain before her, carpeting 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


The stones of Coventry with spring, 
So thou my mist-enwreathéd queen, 
Nicotine, white Nicotine, 
Riding engloried in they hair 
Mak'st by-road of our dreams 
Thy thorough-fare. 




Night Litany 

O Dieu, purifiez nos cceurs! 
Purifiez nos coeurs ! 

Yea the lines hast thou laid unto me 
in pleasant places, 
And the beauty of this thy Venice 
hast thou shown unto me 
Until is its loveliness become unto me 
a thing of tears. 

O God, what great kindness 
have we done in times past 
and forgotten it, 
That thou givest this wonder unto us, 
O God of waters? 

O God of the night, 
What great sorrow 
Cometh unto us, 
That thou thus repayest us 
Before the time of its coming? 

<|endoftext|>

O God of silence, 
Purifiez nos coeurs,

Yea, the glory of the shadow 
of thy Beauty hath walked 
Upon the shadow of the waters 
In this thy Venice. 
And before the holiness 
Of the shadow of thy handmaid 
Have I hidden mine eyes, 
O God of waters. 

O God of silence, 



Purifiez nos coeurs, 
Purifiez nos coeurs, 
O God of waters, 
make clean our hearts within us, 
For I have seen the 
Shadow of this thy Venice 
Floating upon the waters, 
And thy stars 

Have seen this thing, out of their far courses 
Have they seen this thing, 
O God of waters, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Even as are thy stars 
Silent unto us in their far-coursing, 
Even so is mine heart 
become silent within me. 

Purifiez nos coeurs, 
O God of the silence, 
Purifiez nos coeurs, 
O God of waters. 




Notes For Canto Cxx 

I have tried to write Paradise

Let those I love try to forgive

Of Jacopo Del Sellaio 

This man knew out the secret ways of love, 
No man could paint such things who did not know. 
And now she's gone, who was his Cyprian, 
And you are here, who are ‘The Isles’ to me. 

And here's the thing that lasts the whole thing out: 
The eyes of this dead lady speak to me. 




Old Idea Of Choan By Rosoriu 

I 
The narrow streets cut into the wide highway at Choan, 
Dark oxen, white horses, 
drag on the seven coaches with outriders. 
The coaches are perfumed wood, 
The jewelled chair is held up at the crossway, 
Before the royal lodge: 
A glitter of golden saddles, awaiting the princess; 
They eddy before the gate of the barons. 
The canopy embroidered with dragons 
drinks in and casts back the sun. 
Evening comes. 
The trappings are bordered with mist. 
The hundred cords of mist are spread through 
and double the trees, 
Night birds, and night women, 
Spread out their sounds through the gardens. 

II 
Birds with flowery wing, hovering butterflies 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
crowd over the thousand gates, 
Trees that glitter like jade, 
terraces tinged with silver, 
The seed of a myriad hues, 
A net-work of arbours and passages and covered ways, 
Double towers, winged roofs, 
border the net-work of ways: 
A place of felicitous meeting. 
Riu's house stands out on the sky, 
with glitter of colour 
As Butei of Kan had made the high golden lotus 
to gather his dews, 
Before it another house which I do not know: 
How shall we know all the friends 
whom we meet on strange roadways?

She'd come a sweatin' up with the coals 
An a-sloshin' round with 'er mop,

And didn't seem never to stop. 

She died on the job they tells me, 
Fell plump into her pail. 
Never got properly tanked as I saw, 
And never got took to jail, 

Just went on a sloshin' 
And totin' up scuttles of coal, 
And kissin9 her cat fer diversion, 
Cod rest her sloshin’ soul. 

‘Gimme a kissy-cuddle' 
She'd say to her tibby-cat, 
But she never made no mention 
Of this here proletariat. 




On His Own Face In A Glass 

O strange face there in the glass! 
O ribald company, O saintly host, 
O sorrow-swept my fool, 
What answer? O ye myriad 
That strive? and play and pass, 
Jest, challenge, counterlie! 
I? I? I? 
And ye? 




Ortus

<|startoftext|>
How have I laboured? 
How have I not laboured 
To bring her soul to birth, 
To give these elements a name and a centre! 
She is beautiful as the sunlight, and as fluid. 
She has no name, and no place. 
How have I laboured to bring her soul into separation; 
To give her a name and her being! 

Surely you are bound and entwined, 
You are mingled with the elements unborn; 
I have loved a stream and a shadow. 
I beseech you enter your life. 
I beseech you learn to say ‘I’ 
When I question you; 
For you are no part, but a whole, 
No portion, but a being. 




Our Contemporaries 

When the Taihaitian princess 
Heard that he had decided, 
She rushed out into the sunlight and swarmed up a 
cocoanut palm tree, 

But he returned to this island 
And wrote ninety Petrarchan sonnets.

Pan Is Dead 

‘Pan is dead. Great Pan is dead. 
Ah! bow your heads, ye maidens all, 
And weave ye him his coronal.’ 

'There is no summer in the leaves, 
And withered are the sedges; 
How shall we weave a coronal, 
Or gather floral pledges?' 

'That I may not say, Ladies. 
Death was ever a churl. 
That I may not say, Ladies. 
How should he show a reason, 
That he has taken our Lord away 
Upon such hollow season?' 




Paracelsus In Excelsis 

‘Being no longer human, why should I 
Pretend humanity or don the frail attire? 
Men have I known and men, but never one 
Was grown so free an essence, or become 
So simply element as what I am. 
The mist goes from the mirror and I see. 
Behold! the world of forms is swept beneath-
Turmoil grown visible beneath our peace, 
And we that are grown formless, rise above-
Fluids intangible that have been men, 
We seem as statues round whose high-risen base 
Some overflowing river is run mad, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In us alone the element of calm.' 




Phanopoeia 

I 
ROSE WHITE, YELLOW, SILVER 

The swirl of light follows me through the square, 
The smoke of incense 
Mounts from the four horns of my bed-posts, 
The water-jet of gold light bears us up through the ceilings; 
Lapped in the gold-coloured flame I descend through the æther. 
The silver ball forms in my hand, 
It falls and rolls to your feet. 

II 
SALTUS 
The swirling sphere has opened 
and you are caught up to the skies, 
You are englobed in my sapphire. 
Io! Io! 

You have perceived the blades of the flame 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The flutter of sharp-edged sandals. 

The folding and lapping brightness 
Has held in the air before you. 
You have perceived the leaves of the flame. 

III 
CONCAVA VALLIS 
The wire-like bands of colour involute mount from my fingers; 
I have wrapped the wind round your shoulders 
And the molten metal of your shoulders 
bends into the turn of the wind, 

AOI! 
The whirling tissue of light 
is woven and grows solid beneath us; 
The sea-clear sapphire of air, the sea-dark clarity, 
stretches both sea-cliff and ocean.

Phyllidula is scrawny but amorous, 
Thus have the gods awarded her, 
That in pleasure she receives more than she can give; 
If she does not count this blessed 
Let her change her religion. 




Piccadilly 

Beautiful, tragical faces— 
Ye that were whole, and are so sunken; 
And, O ye vile, ye that might have been loved, 
That are so sodden and drunken, 
Who hath forgotten you? 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
O wistful, fragile faces, few out of many! 

The crass, the coarse, the brazen, 
God knows I cannot pity them, perhaps, as I should do; 
But oh, ye delicate, wistful faces, 
Who hath forgotten you? 




Piere Vidal Old 

When I but think upon the great dead days 
And turn my mind upon that splendid madness, 
Lo! I do curse my strength 
And blame the sun his gladness; 
For that the one is dead 
And the red sun mocks my sadness. 

Behold me, Vidal, that was fool of fools! 
Swift as the king wolf was I and as strong 
When tall stags fled me through the alder brakes, 
And every jongleur knew me in his song, 
And the hounds fled and the deer fled 
And none fled over long. 

Even the grey pack knew me and knew fear. 
God! how the swiftest hind's blood spurted hot 
Over the sharpened teeth and purpling lips! 
Hot was that hind's blood yet it scorched me not 
As did first scorn, then lips of the Penautier! 
Aye ye are fools, if ye think time can blot 

From Piere Vidal’s remembrance that blue night. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
God! but the purple of the sky was deep! 
Clear, deep, translucent, so the stars me seemed 
Set deep in crystal; and because my sleep 
Rare visitor came not, the Saints I guerdon 
For that restlessness Piere set to keep 

One more fool's vigil with the hollyhocks. 
Swift came the Loba, as a branch that's caught, 
Torn, green and silent in the swollen Rhone, 
Green was her mantle, close, and wrought 
Of some thin silk stuff that's scarce stuff at all, 
But like a mist wherethrough her white form fought, 

And conquered! Ah God! conquered! 
Silent my mate came as the night was still. 
Speech? Words? Faugh! Who talks of words and love?! 
Hot is such love and silent, 



Silent as fate is, and as strong until 
It faints in taking and in giving all. 

Stark, keen, triumphant, till it plays at death. 
God! she was white then, splendid as some tomb 
High wrought of marble, and the panting breath 
Ceased utterly. Well, then I waited, drew, 
Half-sheathed, then naked from its saffron sheath 
Drew full this dagger that doth tremble here. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Just then she woke and mocked the less keen blade. 
Ah God, the Loba! and my only mate! 
Was there such flesh made ever and unmade! 
God curse the years that turn such women grey! 
Behold here Vidal, that was hunted, flayed, 
Shamed and yet bowed not and that won at last. 

And yet I curse the sun for his red gladness, 
I that have known strath, garth, brake, dale, 
And every run-away of the wood through that great 
madness, 
Behold me shrivelled as an old oak's trunk 
And made men's mock'ry in my rotten sadness! 

No man hath heard the glory of my days: 
No man hath dared and won his dare as I: 
One night, one body and one welding flame! 
What do ye own, ye niggards! that can buy 
Such glory of the earth? Or who will win 
Such battle-guerdon with his 'prowesse high' ? 

O age gone lax! O stunted followers, 
That mask at passions and desire desires, 
Behold me shrivelled, and your mock of mocks; 
And yet I mock you by the mighty fires 
That burnt me to this ash. 

Ah! Cabaret! Ah Cabaret, thy hills again! 

Take your hands off me! . . . [Sniffing the air. 
Ha! this scent is hot!

Planh For The Young English King 

If all the grief and woe and bitterness, 
All dolour, ill and every evil chance 
That ever came upon this grieving world 
Were set together they would seem but light 
Against the death of the young English King. 
Worth lieth riven and Youth dolorous, 
The world overshadowed, soiled and overcast, 
Void of all joy and full of ire and sadness. 

Grieving and sad and full of bitterness 
Are left in teen the liegemen courteous, 
The joglars supple and the troubadours. 
O'er much hath ta'en Sir Death that deadly warrior 
In taking from them the young English King, 
Who made the freest hand seem covetous. 
'Las! Never was nor will be in this world 
The balance for this loss in ire and sadness! 

O skilful Death and full of bitterness, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Well mayst thou boast that thou the best chevalier 
That any folk e'er had, hast from us taken; 
Sith nothing is that unto worth pertaineth 
But had its life in the young English King 
And better were it, should God grant his pleasure, 
That he should live than many a living dastard 
That doth but wound the good with ire and sadness. 

From this faint world, how full of bitterness 
Love takes his way and holds his joy deceitful 
Sith no thing is but turneth unto anguish 
And each to-day Vails less than yestere'en, 
Let each man visage this young English King 
That was most valiant 'mid all worthiest men! 
Gone is his body fine and amorous, 
Whence have we grief, discord and deepest sadness. 

Him, whom it pleased for our great bitterness 
To come to earth to draw us from misventure, 
Who drank of death for our salvacioun, 



Him do we pray as to a Lord most righteous 
And humble eke, that the young English King 
He please to pardon, as true pardon is, 
And bid go in with honoured companions 
There where there is no grief, nor shall be sadness. 




Poem 

(Abbreviated from the conversation with Mr. T E H. 

Over the flat slope of St Eloi 
A wide wall of sandbags. 
Night, 
In the silence desultory men 
Pottering over small fires, cleaning their mess-tins: 
To and fro, from the lines, 
Men walk as on Piccadilly, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Making paths in the dark, 
Through scattered dead horses, 
Over a dead Belgian’s body. 

The Germans have rockets. The English have no rockets, 
Behind the lines, cannon, hidden, lying back miles. 
Before the line, chaos. 

My mind is a corridor. The minds about me are 
corridors. 
Nothing suggests itself. There is nothing to do but keep on. 




Poem By The Bridge At Ten-Shin 

March has come to the bridge head, 
Peach boughs and apricot boughs hang over a thousand 
gates, 
At morning there are flowers to cut the heart, 
And evening drives them on the eastward-flowing 
waters. 
Petals are on the gone waters and on the going, 
And on the back-swirling eddies, 
But to-day's men are not the men of the old days, 
Though they hang in the same way over the bridge-rail. 

The sea's colour moves at the dawn 
And the princes still stand in rows, about the throne, 
And the moon falls over the portals of Sei-go-yo, 
And clings to the walls and the gate-top. 
With head gear glittering against the cloud and sun, 
The lords go forth from the court, and into far borders. 
They ride upon dragon-like horses, 
Upon horses with head-trappings of yellow metal, 
And the streets make way for their passage. 
Haughty their passing, 
Haughty their steps as they go in to great banquets, 
To high halls and curious food, 
To the perfumed air and girls dancing, 
To clear flutes and clear singing; 
To the dance of the seventy couples; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To the mad chase through the gardens. 
Night and day are given over to pleasure 
And they think it will last a thousand autumns, 
Unwearying autumns. 
For them the yellow dogs howl portents in vain, 
And what are they compared to the lady Riokushu, 
That was cause of hate! 
Who among them is a man like Han-rei 
Who departed alone with his mistress, 
With her hair unbound, and he his own skiffsman! 




Poetic Eggs 

I am a grave poetic hen 
That lays poetic eggs 
And to enhance my temperament 
A little quiet begs. 

We make the yolk philosophy, 
True beauty the albumen. 
And then gum on a shell of form 
To make the screed sound human. 




Portrait D'Une Femme 

Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea, 
London has swept about you this score years 
And bright ships left you this or that in fee: 
Ideas, old gossip, oddments of all things, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of price. 
Great minds have sought you -- lacking someone else. 
You have been second always. Tragical? 
No. You preferred it to the usual thing: 
One dull man, dulling and uxorious, 
One average mind -- with one thought less, each year. 
Oh, you are patient, I have seen you sit 
Hours, where something might have floated up. 
And now you pay one. Yes, you richly pay. 
You are a person of some interest, one comes to you 
And takes strange gain away: 
Trophies fished up; some curious suggestion; 
Fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for two, 
Pregnant with mandrakes, or with something else 
That might prove useful and yet never proves, 
That never fits a corner or shows use, 
Or finds its hour upon the loom of days: 
The tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work; 
Idols and ambergris and rare inlays, 
These are your riches, your great store; and yet 
For all this sea-hoard of deciduous things, 
Strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff: 
In the slow float of differing light and deep, 
No! there is nothing! In the whole and all, 
Nothing that's quite your own. 
Yet this is you.

Post Mortem Conspectu 

A brown, fat babe sitting in the lotus, 
And you were glad and laughing 
With a laughter not of this world. 
It is good to splash in the water 
And laughter is the end of all things. 




Praise Of Ysolt 

In vain have I striven, 
to teach my heart to bow; 
In vain have I said to him 
'There be many singers greater than thou'. 

But his answer cometh, as winds and as lutany, 
As a vague crying upon the night 
That leaveth me no rest, saying ever, 
'Song, a song.' 
Their echoes play upon each other in the twilight 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Seeking ever a song. 
Lo, I am worn with travail 
And the wandering of many roads hath made my eyes 
As dark red circles filled with dust. 
Yet there is a trembling upon me in the twilight, 
And little red elf words crying, ‘A song', 
Little grey elf words crying for a song, 
Little brown leaf words crying, ‘A song', 
Little green leaf words crying for a song. 
The words are as leaves, old brown leaves in the spring time 
Blowing they know not whither, seeking a song. 

White words as snow flakes but they are cold, 
Moss words, lip words, words of slow streams. 

In vain have I striven 
to teach my soul to bow, 
In vain have I pled with him: 
'There be greater souls than thou.' 

For in the morn of my years there came a woman 
As moonlight calling, 
As the moon calleth the tides, 
'Song, a song.' 

Wherefore I made her a song and she went from me 
As the moon doth from the sea, 
But still came the leaf words, little brown elf words 
Stying 'The soul sendeth us'. 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

'A song, a song!' 
And in vain I cried unto them ‘I have no song 
For she I sang of hath gone from me'. 

But my soul sent a woman, a woman of the wonder-folk, 
A woman as fire upon the pine woods 
crying 'Song, a song'. 
As the flame crieth unto the sap. 
My song was ablaze with her and she went from me 
As flame leaveth the embers so went she unto new forests ' 
And the words were with me 
crying ever. 'Song, a song'. 

And I 'I have no song', 
Till my soul sent a woman as the sun: 
Yea as the sun calleth to the seed, 
As the spring upon the bough 
So is she that cometh, the mother of songs, 
She that holdeth the wonder words within her eyes 
The words, little elf words 
that call ever unto me, 
'Song, a song'. 

In vain have I striven with my soul 
to teach my soul to bow. 
What soul boweth 
while in his heart art thou? 




Prayer For His Lady’s Life 

FROM PROPERTIUS, ELEGIAE, LIB. III, 26 
Here let thy clemency, Persephone, hold firm, 
Do thou, Pluto, bring here no greater harshness. 
So many thousand beauties are gone down to Avernus, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Ye might let one remain above with us. 

With you is lope, with you the white-gleaming Tyro, 
With you is Europa and the shameless Pasiphae, 
And all the fair from Troy and all from Achaia, 
From the sundered realms, of Thebes and of aged Priamus; 
And all the maidens of Rome, as many as they were, 
They died and the greed of your flame consumes them. 

Here let thy clemency, Persephone, hold firm. 
Do thou, Pluto, bring here no greater harshness. 
So many thousandfair are gone down to Avernus, 
Ye might let one remain above with us. 




Provincia Deserta 

At Rochecoart, 
Where the hills part 
in three ways, 
And three valleys, full of winding roads, 
Fork out to south and north, 
There is a place of trees . . . gray with lichen. 
I have walked there 
thinking of old days. 
At Chalais 
is a pleached arbour; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Old pensioners and old protected \vomen 
Have the right there 
it is charity. 
I have crept over old rafters, 
peering down 
Over the Dronne, 
over a stream full of lilies. 
Eastward the road lies, 
Aubeterre is eastward, 
With a garrulous old man at the inn. 
I know the roads in that place: 
Mareuil to the north-east, 
La Tour, 
There are three keeps near Mareuil, 
And an old woman, 
glad to hear Arnaut, 
Glad to lend one dry clothing. 

I have walked 
into Perigord, 
I have seen the torch-flames, high-leaping, 
Painting the front of that church; 
Heard, under the dark, whirling laughter. 
I have looked back over the stream 
and seen the high building, 
Seen the long minarets, the white shafts. 
I have gone in Ribeyrac 
and in Sarlat, 
I have climbed rickety stairs, heard talk of Croy, 



Walked over En Bertran's old layout, 
Have seen Narbonne, and Cahors and Chalus, 
Have seen Excideuil, carefully fashioned. 

I have said: 
‘Here such a one walked. 
‘Here Cceur-de-Lion was slain. 
'Here was good singing. 
'Here one man hastened his step. 
'Here one lay panting.' 
I have looked south from Hautefort, 
thinking of Montaignac, southward. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I have lain in Rocafixada, 
level with sunset, 
Have seen the copper come down 
tingeing the mountains, 
I have seen the fields, pale, clear as an emerald, 
Sharp peaks, high spurs, distant castles. 
I have said: The old roads have lain here. 
'Men have gone by such valleys 
‘Where the great halls were closer together.' 
I have seen Foix on its rock, seen Toulouse, and 
Aries greatly altered, 
I have seen the ruined 'Dorata'. 
I have said: 
'Riquier! Guido.' 
I have thought of the second Troy, 
Some little prized place in Auvergnat: 
Two men tossing a coin, one keeping a castle, 
One set on the highway to sing. 
He sang a woman, 
Auvergne rose to the song; 
The Dauphin backed him. 
'The castle to Austors!' 
'Pieire kept the singing 
‘A fair man and a pleasant.' 
He won the lady, 
Stole her away for himself, kept her against armed force: 
So ends that story. 
That age is gone; 
Pieire de Maensac is gone. 
I have walked over these roads; 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

I have thought of them living. 



Quies 

This is another of our ancient loves. 
Pass and be silent, Rullus, for the day 
Hath lacked a something since this lady passed; 
Hath lacked a something. 'Twas but marginal. 




Rome 

O thou newcomer who seek’st Rome in Rome 
And find’st in Rome no thing thou canst call Roman; 
Arches worn old and palaces made common 
Rome’s name alone within these walls keeps home. 

Behold how pride and ruin can befall 
One who hath set the whole world ’neath her laws, 
All-conquering, now conquered, because 
She is Time’s prey, and Time conquereth all. 

Rome that art Rome’s one sole last monument, 
Rome that alone hast conquered Rome the town, 
Tiber alone, transient and seaward bent, 

Remains of Rome. O world, thou unconstant mime! 
That which stands firm in thee Time batters down, 
And that which fleeteth doth outrun swift Time. 




Safe And Sound

My name is Nunty Cormorant 
And my finance is sound, 
I lend you Englishmen hot air 
At one and three the pound. 

I lend you Englishmen hot air 
And I get all the beef 
While you stalwart sheep of freedom 
Are on the poor relief. 

Wot oh! my buxom hearties, 
What ain't got work no more 
And don't know what bug is a-bitin' 
To keep your feelin's sore, 

There is blokes in automobiles 
And their necks sunk into fur 
That keep on gettin' usury 
To make 'em cosier. 

I read these fellers puts it 
Most tidily away 
And then lends out their printed slips 
To keep the wolf away 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
From the vaults and combination 
Safes in Thread and Needle street. 
I wouldn't 'ave the needle 
If I had more grub to eat. 

Oh the needle is your portion, 
My sufferin' fellow men, 
Till the King shall take the notion 
To own his coin again. 




Salutation 

O generation of the thoroughly smug 
and thoroughly uncomfortable, 
I have seen fishermen picnicking in the sun, 
I have seen them with untidy families, 
I have seen their smiles full of teeth 
and heard ungainly laughter. 
And I am happier than you are, 
And they were happier than I am; 
And the fish swim in the lake 
and do not even own clothing. 




Salutation The Second 

You were praised, my books, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
because I had just come from the country; 
I was twenty years behind the times 
so you found an audience ready. 
I do not disown you, 
do not you disown your progeny. 

Here they stand without quaint devices, 
Here they are with nothing archaic about them. 
Observe the irritation in general: 

‘Is this’ they say, 'the nonsense 
that we expect of poets?’ 
'Where is the Picturesque ?' 
‘Where is the vertigo of emotion?' 
‘No! his first work was the best.’ 
'Poor Dear! he has lost his illusions.’ 

Go, little naked and impudent songs, 
Go with a light foot! 
(Or with two light feet, if it please you!) 
Go and dance shamelessly! 
Go with an impertinent frolic! 

Greet the grave and the stodgy, 
Salute them with your thumbs at your noses. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Here are your bells and confetti. 
Go! rejuvenate things! 
Rejuvenate even 'The Spectator.’ 
Go! and make cat calls! 
Dance and make people blush, 
Dance the dance of the phallus 
and tell anecdotes of Cybele! 
Speak of the indecorous conduct of the Gods! 
(Tell it to Mr. Strachey) 

Ruffle the skirts of prudes, 
speak of their knees and ankles. 



But, above all, go to practical people 
go! jangle their door-bells! 
Say that you do no work 
and that you will live forever. 




Salutation The Third 

Let us deride the smugness of 'The Times': GUFFAW! 
So much for the gagged reviewers, 
It will pay them when the worms are wriggling in their 
vitals; 
These are they who objected to newness, 
Here are their tomb-stones. 
They supported the gag and the ring: 
A little BLACK Box contains them. 
So shall you be also, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
You slut-bellied obstructionist, 
You sworn foe to free speech and good letters, 
You fungus, you continuous gangrene. 

Come, let us on with the new deal, 
Let us be done with pandars and jobbery, 
Let us spit upon those who pat the big-bellies for profit, 
Let us go out in the air a bit. 

Or perhaps I will die at thirty? 
Perhaps you will have the pleasure of defiling my 
pauper's grave; 
I wish you joy, I proffer you all my assistance. 
It has been your habit for long 
to do away with good writers, 
You either drive them mad, or else you blink at their 
suicides, 
Or else you condone their drugs, 
and talk of insanity and genius, 
But I will not go mad to please you, 
I will not flatter you with an early death, 
Oh, no, I will stick it out, 
Feel your hates wriggling about my feet 
As a pleasant tickle, 
to be observed with derision, 
Though many move with suspicion, 
Afraid to say that they hate you; 
The taste of my boot ? 
Here is the taste of my boot, 
Caress it, 



lick off the blacking. 



Salvationists 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I 
Come, my songs, let us speak of perfection 
We shall get ourselves rather disliked. 

II 
Ah yes, my songs, let us resurrect 
The very excellent term Rusticus. 
Let us apply it in all its opprobrium 
To those to whom it applies. 
And you may decline to make them immortal, 
For we shall consider them and their state 
In delicate 
Opulent silence. 

III 
Come, my songs, 
Let us take arms against this sea of stupidities-
Beginning with Mumpodorus; 
And against this sea of vulgarities 
Beginning with Nimmim; 
And against this sea of imbeciles 
All the Bulmenian literati. 




Satiemus 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

What if I know thy speeches word by word? 
And if thou knew'st I knew them wouldst thou speak? 
What if I know thy speeches word by word, 
And all the time thou sayest them o'er I said, 
'Lo, one there was who bent her fair bright head, 
Sighing as thou dost through the golden speech.' 
Or, as our laughters mingle each with each, 
As crushed lips take their respite fitfully, 
What if my thoughts were turned in their mid reach 
Whispering among them, 'The fair dead 
Must know such moments, thinking on the grass; 
On how white dogwoods murmured overhead 
In the bright glad days!' 
How if the low dear sound within thy throat 
Hath as faint lute-strings in its dim accord 
Dim tales that blind me, running one by one 
With times told over as we tell by rote; 
What if I know thy laughter word by word 
Nor find aught novel in thy merriment ? 




Sennin Poem By Kakuhaku 

The red and green kingfishers 
flash between the orchids and clover, 
One bird casts its gleam on another. 
Green vines hang through the high forest, 
They weave a whole roof to the mountain, 
The lone man sits with shut speech, 
He purrs and pats the clear strings. 
He throws his heart up through the sky, 
He bites through the flower pistil 
and brings up a fine fountain. 
The red-pine-tree god looks at him and wonders. 
He rides through the purple smoke to visit the sennin, 
He takes 'Floating Hill' by the sleeve, 
He claps his hand on the back of the great water sennin. 

But you, you dam'd crowd of gnats, 
Can you even tell the age of a turtle?

Separation On The River Kiang 

Ko-Jin goes west from Ko-kaku-ro, 
The smoke-flowers are blurred over the river. 
His lone sail blots the far sky. 
And now I see only the river, 
The long Kiang, reaching heaven. 




Sestina: Altaforte 

Loquitur: En Bertrans de Born. 
Dante Alighieri put this man in hell for that he was a 
stirrer-up of strife. 
Eccovi! 
Judge ye! 
Have I dug him up again? 
The scene in at his castle, Altaforte. "Papiols" is his jongleur. 
"The Leopard," the device of Richard (Cúur de Lion). 

I 

Damn it all! all this our South stinks peace. 
You whoreson dog, Papiols, come! Let's to music! 
I have no life save when the swords clash. 
But ah! when I see the standards gold, vair, purple, opposing 
And the broad fields beneath them turn crimson, 
Then howl I my heart nigh mad with rejoicing. 

II 

In hot summer have I great rejoicing 
When the tempests kill the earth's foul peace, 
And the lightnings from black heav'n flash crimson, 
And the fierce thunders roar me their music 
And the winds shriek through the clouds mad, opposing, 
And through all the riven skies God's swords clash. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
III 

Hell grant soon we hear again the swords clash! 
And the shrill neighs of destriers in battle rejoicing, 
Spiked breast to spiked breast opposing! 
Better one hour's stour than a year's peace 
With fat boards, bawds, wine and frail music! 
Bah! there's no wine like the blood's crimson! 

IV 

And I love to see the sun rise blood-crimson. 



And I watch his spears through the dark clash 
And it fills all my heart with rejoicing 
And pries wide my mouth with fast music 
When I see him so scorn and defy peace, 
His lone might 'gainst all darkness opposing. 

V 

The man who fears war and squats opposing 
My words for stour, hath no blood of crimson 
But is fit only to rot in womanish peace 
Far from where worth's won and the swords clash 
For the death of such sluts I go rejoicing; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Yea, I fill all the air with my music. 

VI 

Papiols, Papiols, to the music! 
There's no sound like to swords swords opposing, 
No cry like the battle's rejoicing 
When our elbows and swords drip the crimson 
And our charges 'gainst "The Leopard's" rush clash. 
May God damn for ever all who cry "Peace!" 

VII 

And let the music of the swords make them crimson! 
Hell grant soon we hear again the swords clash! 
Hell blot black for always the thought "Peace!" 




Shop Girl 

For a moment she rested against me 
Like a swallow half blown to the wall, 
And they talk of Swinburne's women, 
And the shepherdess meeting with Guido. 
And the harlots of Baudelaire. 




Silet 

When I behold how black, immortal ink 
Drips from my deathless pen - ah, well-away! 
Why should we stop at all for what I think? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
There is enough in what I chance to say. 

It is enough that we once came together; 
What is the use of setting it to rime? 
When it is autumn do we get spring weather, 
Or gather may of harsh northwindish time? 

It is enough that we once came together; 
What if the wind have turned against the rain? 
It is enough that we once came together; 
Time has seen this, and will not turn again; 

And who are we, who know that last intent, 
To plague to-morrow with a testament! 




Simulacra 

Why does the horse-faced lady of just the unmentionable age 
Walk down Longacre reciting Swinburne to herself, inaudibly? 
Why does the small child in the soiled-white imitation fur coat 
Crawl in the very black gutter beneath the grape stand? 
Why does the really handsome young woman approach me in Sackville Street 
Undeterred by the manifest age of my trappings? 




Society 

The family position was waning, 
And on this account the little Aurelia, 
Who had laughed on eighteen summers, 
Now bears the palsied contact of Phidippus. 




Song

<|startoftext|>

Winter is icummen in, 
Lhude sing Goddamm, 
Raineth drop and staineth slop, 
and how the wind doth ramm, 
Sing: Goddamm. 
Skiddeth bus and sloppeth us, 
An ague hath my ham. 
Freezeth river, turneth liver, 
Damn you, sing: Goddamm. 
Goddamm, Goddamm, 'tis why I am, Goddamm, 
So 'gainst the winter's balm. 
Sing goddamm, damm, sing Goddamm, 

Sing goddamm, sing goddamm, DAMM. 




Song In The Manner Of Housman 

O woe, woe, 
People are born and die, 
We also shall be dead pretty soon 
Therefore let us act as if we were 
dead already. 

The bird sits on the hawthorn tree 
But he dies also, presently. 
Some lads get hung, and some get shot. 
Woeful is this human lot. 
<i>Woe! woe, etcetera . . . .</i> 

London is a woeful place, 
Shropshire is much pleasanter. 
Then let us smile a little space 
Upon fond nature's morbid grace. 
<i>Oh, Woe, woe, woe, etcetera . . . </i>

Song Of The Bowmen Of Shu 

Here we are, picking the first fern-shoots 
And saying: When shall we get back to our country? 
Here we are because we have the Ken-nin for our foemen, 
We have no comfort because of these Mongols. 
We grub the soft fern-shoots, 
When anyone says "Return," the others are full of sorrow. 
Sorrowful minds, sorrow is strong, we are hungry and thirsty. 
Our defence is not yet made sure, no one can let his friend return. 
We grub the old fern-stalks. 
We say: Will we be let to go back in October? 
There is no ease in royal affairs, we have no comfort. 
Our sorrow is bitter, but we would not return to our country. 
What flower has come into blossom? 
Whose chariot? The General's. 
Horses, his horses even, are tired. They were strong. 
We have no rest, trhee battles a month. 
By heavn, his horses are tired. 
The generals are on them, the soldiers are by them. 
The horses are well trained, the generals have ivory arrows and 
quivers ornamented with fish-skin. 
The enemy is swift, we must be careful. 
When we set out, the willows were drooping with spring, 
We come back in the snow, 
We go slowly, we are hungry and thirsty, 
Our mind is full of sorrow, who will know of our grief? 

<i>By Bunno, reputedly 1100 B. C.</i> 




Song Of The Six Hundred M.P.'s 

‘We are 'ere met together 
in this momentous hower, 
Ter lick th' bankers' dirty boots 
an' keep the Bank in power.’ 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

We are 'ere met together 
ter grind the same old axes 
And keep the people in its place 
a'payin' us the taxes. 

We are six hundred beefy men 
(but mostly gas and suet) 
An’ every year we meet to let 
some other feller do it.' 

I see their 'igh 'ats on the seats 
an' them sprawling on the benches 
And thinks about a Rowton 'ouse 
and a lot of small street stenches. 

'O Britain, muvver of parliaments, 
'ave you seen yer larst sweet litter? 
Could yeh swap th' brains of orl this lot 
fer 'arft a pint o' bitter?' 

‘I couldn't,' she sez, ‘an' I aint tried, 
They're me own,' she sez to me, 
‘As footlin' a lot as was ever spawned 
to defend democracy.' 




South-Folk In Cold Country 

The Dai horse neighs against the bleak wind of Etsu, 
The birds of Etsu have no love for En, in the north, 
Emotion is born out of habit. 
Yesterday we went out of the Wild-Goose gate, 
To-day from the Dragon-Pen. 
Surprised. Desert turmoil. Sea sun. 
Flying snow bewilders the barbarian heaven. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Lice swarm like ants over our accoutrements. 
Mind and spirit drive on the feathery banners. 
Hard fight gets no reward. 
Loyalty is hard to explain. 
Who will be sorry for General Rishogu, 
the swift moving, 
Whose white head is lost for this province? 




Speech For Psyche In The Golden Book Of Apuleius 

All night, and as the wind lieth among 
The cypress trees, he lay, 
Nor held me save as air that brusheth by one 
Close, and as the petals of flowers in falling 
Waver and seem not drawn to earth, so he 
Seemed over me to hover light as leaves 
And closer me than air, 
And music flowing through me seemed to open 
Mine eyes upon new colours. 
O winds, what wind can match the weight of him! 




ßìyñññù (Greek Title) 

Thy soul

I long for thy narrow breasts, 
Thou restless, ungathered.

Statement Of Being 

I am a grave poetic hen 
That lays poetic eggs 
And to enhance my temperament 
A little quiet begs. 

We make the yolk philosophy, 
True beauty the albumen. 
And then gum on a shell of form 
To make the screed sound human. 




Sub Mare 

It is, and is not, I am sane enough, 
Since you have come this place has hovered round me, 
This fabrication built of autumn roses, 
Then there's a goldish colour, different. 

And one gropes in these things as delicate 
Algæ reach up and out, beneath 
Pale slow green surgings of the underwave, 
'Mid these things older than the names they have, 
These things that are familiears of the god. 




Surgit Fama 

There is a truce among the gods, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Kore is seen in the North 
Skirting the blue-gray sea 
In gilded and russet mantle. 
The corn has again it's mother and she, Leuconoe, 
That failed never women, 
Fails not the earth now. 

The tricksome Hermes is here; 
He moves behind me 
Eager to catch my words, 
Eager to spread them with rumour; 
To set upon them his change 
Crafty and subtle; 
To alter them to his purpose; 
But do thou speak true, even to the letter: 

‘Once more in Delos, once more is the altar a-quiver. 
Once more is the chant heard. 
Once more are the never abandoned gardens 
Full of gossip and old tales.’ 




Taking Leave Of A Friend 

Blue mountains to the north of the walls, 
White river winding about them; 
Here we must make separation 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And go out through a thousand miles of dead grass. 

Mind like a floating wide cloud, 
Sunset like the parting of old acquaintances 
Who bow over their clasped hands at a distance. 
Our horses neigh to each others 
as we are departing. 




Tame Cat 

It rests me to be among beautiful women 
Why should one always lie about such matters? 
I repeat: 
It rests me to converse with beautiful women 
Even though we talk nothing but nonsense, 

The purring of the invisible antennae 
Is both stimulating and delightful. 




Tempora 

Io! Io! Tamuz! 
The Dryad staiids in my court-yard 
With plaintive, querulous crying. 
(Tamuz. Io! Tamuz!) 
Oh, no, she is not crying: 'Tamuz.' 
She says, 'May my poems be printed this week? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The god Pan is afraid to ask you, 
May my poems be printed this week?' 




Tenzone 

Will people accept them? 

(i.e. these songs). 
As a timorous wench from a centaur 
(or a centurion), 
Already they flee, howling in terror. 
Will they be touched with the verisimilitudes? 
Their virgin stupidity is untemptable. 
I beg you, my friendly critics, 
Do not set about to procure me an audience. 

I mate with my free kind upon the crags; 
the hidden recesses 
Have heard the echo ofmy heels, 
in the cool light, 
in the darkness. 




The Alchemist 

Chant for the Transmutation of Metals 

Sail of Claustra, Aelis, Azalais, 
As you move among the bright trees; 
As your voices, under the larches of Paradise 
Make a clear sound, 
Sail of Claustra, Aelis, Azalais, 
Raimona, Tibors, Berangere, 
'Neath the dark gleam of the sky; 
Under night, the peacock-throated, 
Bring the saffron-coloured shell, 
Bring the red gold of the maple, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Bring the light of the birch tree in autumn 
Mirals, Cembelins, Audiarda, 
Remember this fire. 
Elain, Tireis, Alcmena 
'Mid the silver rustling of wheat, 
Agradiva, Anhes, Ardenca, 
From the plum-coloured lake, in stillness, 
From the molten dyes of the water 
Bring the burnished nature of fire; 
Briseis, Lianor, Loica, 
From the wide earth and the olive, 
From the poplars weeping their amber, 
By the bright flame of the fishing torch 
Remember this fire. 
Midonz, with the gold of the sun, the leaf of the poplar, 
by the light of the amber, 
Midonz, daughter of the sun, shaft of the tree, silver of 
the leaf, light of the yellow of the amber, 
Midonz, gift of the God, gift of the light, gift of the 
amber of the sun, 
Give light to the metal. 
Anhes of Rocacoart, Ardenca, Aemelis, 
From the power of grass, 
From the white, alive in the seed, 
From the heat of the bud, 
From the copper .of the leaf in autumn, 
From the bronze of the maple, from the sap in the 



bough; 
Lianor, loanna, Loica, 
By the stir of the fin, 
By the trout asleep in the gray-green of water; 
Vanna, Mandetta, Viera, Alodetta, Picarda, Manuela 
From the red gleam of copper, 
Ysaut, Ydone, slight rustling of leaves, 
Vierna, Jocelynn, daring of spirits, 
By the mirror of burnished copper, 
O Queen of Cypress, 
Out of Erebus, the flat-lying breadth, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Breath that is stretched out beneath the world: 
Out of Erebus, out of the flat waste of air, lying beneath 
the world; 
Out of the brown leaf-brown colourless 
Bring the imperceptible cool. 
Elain, Tireis, Alcmena, 
Quiet this metal! 
Let the manes put off their terror, let them put off their 
aqueous bodies with fire. 
Let them assume the milk-white bodies of agate. 
Let them draw together the bones of the metal. 
Selvaggia, Guiscarda, Mandetta, 
Rain flakes of gold on the water 
Azure and flaking silver of water, 
Alcyon, Phaetona, Alcmena, 
Pallor of silver, pale lustre of Latona, 
By these, from the malevolence of the dew 
Guard this alembic. 
Elain, Tireis, Allodetta 
Quiet this metal. 




The Altar 

Let us build here an exquisite friendship, 
The flame, the autumn, and the green rose of love 
Fought out their strife here, 'tis a place of wonder; 
Where these have been, meet 'tis, the ground is holy. 




The Baby 

The baby new to earth and sky 
Has never until now 
Unto himself the question put 
Or asked us if the cow 

Is higher in the mental scale 
Than men like me and you, 
Or if the cow refrains from food 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Till she finds work to do. 

'The baby new to earth and sky,' 
As Tennyson has written, 
Just goes ahead and sucks a teat 
Like to-day's great men in Britain. 




The Bath-Tub 

As a bathtub lined with white porcelain, 
When the hot water gives out or goes tepid, 
So is the slow cooling of our chivalrous passion, 
O my much praised but-not-altogether-satisfactory lady. 




The Beautiful Toilet 

Blue, blue is the grass about the river 
And the willows have overfilled the close garden. 
And within, the mistress, in the midmost of her youth. 
White, white of face, hesitates, passing the door. 
Slender, she puts forth a slender hand; 

And she was a courtezan in the old days, 
And she has married a sot, 
Who now goes drunkenly out 
And leaves her too much alone.

The Bellaires 

The good Bellaires 
Do not understand the conduct of this world's affairs. 
In fact they understood them so badly 
That they have had to cross the Channel. 
Nine lawyers, four counsels, five judges and three 
proctors of the King, 
Together with the respective wives, husbands, sisters 
and heterogeneous connections of the good Bellaires, 
Met to discuss their affairs; 
But the good Bellaires have so little understood their 
affairs 
That now there is no one at all 
Who can understand any affair of theirs. Yet 
Fourteen hunters still eat in the stables of 
The good Squire Bellaire; 
But these may not suffer attainder, 
For they may not belong to the good Squire Bellaire 
But to his wife. 
On the contrary, if they do not belong to his wife, 
He will plead 
A 'freedom from attainder' 
For twelve horses and also for twelve boarhounds 
From Charles the Fourth; 
And a further freedom for the remainder 
Of horses, from Henry the Fourth. 
But the judges, 
Being free of mediaeval scholarship, 
Will pay no attention to this, 
And there will be only the more confusion, 
Replevin, estoppel, espavin and what not. 

Nine lawyers, four counsels, etc., 
Met to discuss their affairs, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But the sole result was bills 
From lawyers to whom no one was indebted, 
And even the lawyers 
Were uncertain who was supposed to be indebted to 
them. 



Wherefore the good Squire Bellaire 
Resides now at Agde and Biaucaire, 
To Carcassonne, Pui, and Alais 
He fareth from day to day, 
Or takes the sea air 
Between Marseilles 
And Beziers. 
And for all this I have considerable regret, 
For the good Bellaires 
Are very charming people. 




The Charge Of The Bread Brigade 

Half a loaf, half a loaf, 
Half a loaf? Urn-hum? 
Down through the vale of gloom 
Slouched the ten million, 
Onward th' 'ungry blokes, 
Crackin' their smutty jokes! 
We'll send 'em mouchin' 'ome, 
Damn the ten million!

There goes the night brigade, 
They got no steady trade, 
Several old so'jers know 
Monty has blunder'd.

Theirs but to buy the pie, 
Slouching and mouching, 
Lousy ten million! 

Plenty to right of 'em, 
Plenty to left of 'em, 
Yes, wot is left of 'em, 
Damn the ten million. 
Stormed at by press and all, 
How shall we dress 'em all? 
Glooming and mouching! 

See 'em go slouching there, 
With cowed and crouching air 
Dundering dullards! 
How the whole nation shook 
While Milord Beaverbrook 
Fed 'em with hogwash!

The City Of Choan 

The phoenix are at play on their terrace. 
The phoenix are gone, the river Hows on alone. 
Flowers and grass 
Cover over the dark path 
where lay the dynastic house of the Go. 
The bright cloths and bright caps of Shin 
Are now the base of old hills. 

The Three Mountains fall through the far heaven, 
The isle of White Heron 
splits the two streams apart. 
Now the high clouds cover the sun 
And I can not see Choan afar 
And I am sad. 




The Cloak 

Thou keep'st thy rose-leaf 
Till the rose-time will be over, 
Think'st thou that Death will kiss thee? 
Think'st thou that the Dark House 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Will find thee such a lover 
As I? Will the new roses miss thee? 

Prefer my cloak unto the cloak of dust 
'Neath which the last year lies, 
For thou shouldst more mistrust 
Time than my eyes. 




The Coming Of War: Actaeon 

An image of Lethe, 
and the fields 
Full of faint light 
but golden, 
Gray cliffs, 
and beneath them 

A sea 
Harsher than granite, 
unstill, never ceasing; 
High forms 
with the movement of gods, 
Perilous aspect; 
And one said: 
'This is Actaeon.' 
Actaeon of golden greaves! 
Over fair meadows, 
Over the cool face of that field, 
Unstill, ever moving 
Hosts of an ancient people, 
The silent cortège. 




The Condolence 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
O my fellow sufferers, songs of my youth, 
A lot of asses praise you because you are 'virile', 
We, you, I! We are 'Red Bloods'! 
Imagine it, my fellow sufferers 
Our maleness lifts us out of the ruck, 
Who'd have foreseen it? 

O my fellow sufferers, we went out under the trees, 
We were in especial bored with male stupidity. 
We went forth gathering delicate thoughts, 
Our ‘fantastikon’ delighted to serve us. 
We were not exasperated with women, 
for the female is ductile. 

And now you hear what is said to us: 
We are compared to that sort of person 
Who wanders about announcing his sex 
As if he had just discovered it. 
Let us leave this matter, my songs, 
and return to that which concerns us. 




The Encounter 

All the while they were talking the new morality 
Her eyes explored me. 
And when I rose to go 
Her fingers were like the tissue 
Of a Japanese paper napkin. 




The Eyes 

Rest Master, for we be a-weary, weary 
And would feel the fingers of the wind 
Upon these lids that lie over us 
Sodden and lead-heavy. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Rest brother, for lo ! the dawn is without ! 
The yellow flame paleth 
And the wax runs low. 

Free us, for without be goodly colours, 
Green of the wood-moss and flower colours, 
And coolness beneath the trees. 

Free us, for we perish 
In this ever-flowing monotony 
Of ugly print marks, black 
Upon white parchment. 

Free us, for there is one 
Whose smile more availeth 
Than all the age-old knowledge of thy books: 
And we would look thereon. 




The Fault Of It 

Some may have blamed us that we cease to speak 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of things we spoke of in our verses early, 
Saying: a lovely voice is such as such; 
Saying: that lady's eyes were sad last week, 
Wherein the world's whole joy is born and dies; 
Saying: she hath this way or that, this much 
Of grace, this way or that, this much 
Of grace, this little misericorde; 
Ask us no further word; 
If we were proud, then proud to be so wise 
Ask us no more of all the things ye heard; 
We may not speak of them, they touch us nearly. 




The Faun 

Ha! sir, I have seen you sniffing and snoozling 
about among my flowers. 
And what, pray, do you know about 
horticulture, you capriped? 
'Come, Auster, come Apeliota, 
And see the faun in our garden. 
But if you move or speak 
This thing will run at you 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And scare itself to spasms.' 




The Flame 

‘Tis not a game that plays at mates and mating, 
Provençe knew; 
'Tis not a game of barter, lands and houses, 
Provençe knew. 
We who are wise beyond your dream of wisdom, 
Drink our immortal moments; we 'pass through'. 
We have gone forth beyond your bonds and borders, 
Provençe knew; 
And all the tales of Oisin say but this: 
That man doth pass the net of days and hours. 
Where time is shrivelled down to time's seed corn 
We of the Ever-living, in that light 
Meet through our veils and whisper, and of love. 

O smoke and shadow of a darkling world, 
These, and the rest, and all the rest we knew. 
'Tis not a game that plays at mates and mating, 
'Tis not a game of barter, lands and houses, 
'Tis not 4of days and nights' and troubling years, 
Of cheeks grown sunken and glad hair gone gray; 
There is the subtler music, the clear light 
Where time burns back about th' eternal embers. 
We are not shut from all the thousand heavens: 
Lo, there are many gods whom we have seen, 
Folk of unearthly fashion, places splendid, 
Bulwarks of beryl and of chrysoprase. 

Sapphire Benacus, in thy mists and thee 
Nature herself's turned metaphysical, 
Who can look on that blue and not believe? 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Thou hooded opal, thou eternal pearl, 
O thou dark secret with a shimmering floor, 
Through all thy various mood I know thee mine; 
If I have merged my soul, or utterly 
Am solved and bound in, through aught here on earth, 
There canst thou find me, O thou anxious thou, 
Who call’st about my gates for some lost me; 
I say my soul flowed back, became translucent. 



Search not my lips, O Love, let go my hands, 
This thing that moves as man is no more mortal. 
If thou hast seen my shade sans character, 
If thou hast seen that mirror of all moments, 
That glass to all things that o'ershadow it, 
Call not that mirror me, for I have slipped 
Your grasp, I have eluded. 




The Game Of Chess 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Red knights, brown bishops, bright queens, 
Striking the board, falling in strong ‘L's of 
colour. 
Reaching and striking in angles, 
holding lines in one colour. 
This board is alive with light; 
these pieces are living in form, 
Their moves break and reform the pattern: 
luminous green from the rooks, 
Clashing with ‘X's of queens, 
looped with the knight-leaps. 

‘Y' pawns, cleaving, embanking! 
Whirl ! Centripetal ! Mate ! King down in the 
vortex, 
Clash, leaping of bands, straight strips of hard 
colour, 
Blocked lights working in. Escapes. Renewal of 
contest. 




The Garden 

En robe de parade. Samain 

Like a skein of loose silk blown against a wall 
She walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens, 
And she is dying piece-meal 
      Tof a sort of emotional anaemia. 

And round about there is a rabble 
Of the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor. 
They shall inherit the earth. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In her is the end of breeding. 
Her boredom is exquisite and excessive. 
She would like some one to speak to her, 
And is almost afraid that I 
      Twill commit that indiscretion. 




The Garrett 

Come, let us pity those who are better off than we are. 
Come, my friend, and remember 
that the rich have butlers and no 
friends, 
And we have friends and no butlers. 
Come, let us pity the married and the unmarried. 

Dawn enters with little feet 
like a gilded Pavlova 
And I am near my desire. 
Nor has life in it aught better 
Than this hour of clear coolness 
the hour of waking together. 




The Gypsy 

That was the top of the walk, when he said: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
'Have you seen any others, any of our lot, 
With apes or bears?' 
A brown upstanding fellow 
Not like the half-castes, 
up on the wet road near Clermont. 
The wind came, and the rain, 
And mist clotted about the trees in the valley, 
And I’d the long ways behind me, 
gray Aries and Biaucaire, 
And he said, 'Have you seen any of our lot?' 
I'd seen a lot of his lot . . . 
ever since Rhodez, 
Coming down from the fair 
of St. John, 
With caravans, but never an ape or a bear. 




The House Of Splendour 

‘Tis Evanoe's, 
A house not made with hands, 
But out somewhere beyond the worldly ways 
Her gold is spread, above, around, inwoven; 
Strange ways and walls are fashioned out of it. 

And I have seen my Lady in the sun, 
Her hair was spread about, a sheaf of wings, 
And red the sunlight was, behind it all. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

And I have seen her there within her house, 
With six great sapphires hung along the wall, 
Low, panel-shaped, a-level with her knees, 
All her robe was woven of pale gold. 

There are there many rooms and all of gold, 
Of woven walls deep patterned, of email, 
Of beaten work; and through the claret stone, 
Set to some weaving, comes the aureate light. 

Here am I come perforce my love of her, 
Behold mine adoration 
Maketh me clear, and there are powers in this 
Which, played on by the virtues of her soul, 
Break down the four-square walls of standing time. 




The Jewel Stairs' Grievance 

The jewelled steps are already quite white with dew, 
It is so late that the dew soaks my gauze stockings, 
And I let down the crystal curtain 
And watch the moon through the clear autumn. 




The Lake Isle 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
O God, O Venus, O Mercury, patron of thieves, 
Give me in due time, I beseech you, a little tobacco-shop, 
With the little bright boxes 
piled up neatly upon the shelves 
And the loose fragment cavendish 
and the shag, 
And the bright Virginia 
loose under the bright glass cases, 
And a pair of scales 
not too greasy, 
And the votailles dropping in for a word or two in passing, 
For a flip word, and to tidy their hair a bit. 

O God, O Venus, O Mercury, patron of thieves, 
Lend me a little tobacco-shop, 
or install me in any profession 
Save this damn'd profession of writing, 
where one needs one's brains all the time. 




The Logical Conclusion 

When earth's last thesis is copied 
From the theses that went before, 
When idea from fact has departed 
And bare-boned factlets shall bore, 
When all joy shall have fled from study 
And scholarship reign supreme; 
When truth shall 'baaa' on the hill crests 
And no one shall dare to dream; 

When all the good poems have been buried 
With comment annoted in full 
And art shall bow down in homage 
To scholarship's zinc-plated bull, 
When there shall be nothing to research 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But the notes of annoted notes, 
And Baalam's ass shall inquire 
The price of imported oats; 

Then no one shall tell him the answer 
For each shall know the one fact 
That lies in the special ass-ignment 
From which he is making his tract. 
So the ass shall sigh uninstructed 
While each in his separate book 
Shall grind for the love of grinding 
And only the devil shall look. 

Against the 'germanic' system of graduate study and insane specialization in the 
Inanities. 




The Needle 

Come, or the stellar tide will slip away. 
Eastward avoid the hour of its decline, 
Now! for the needle trembles in my soul! 

Here have we had the vantage, the good hour. 
Here we have had our day, your day and mine. 
Come now, before this power 
That bears us up, shall turn against the pole. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Mock not the flood of stars, the thing's to be. 
O Love, come now, this land turns evil slowly. 
The waves bore in, soon will they bear away. 

The treasure is ours, make we fast land with it. 
Move we and take the tide, with its next favour, 
Abide 
Under some neutral force 
Until this course turneth aside. 




The New Cake Of Soap 

Lo, how it gleams and glistens in the sun 
Like the cheek of a Chesterton. 




The Patterns 

Erinna is a model parent, 
Her children have never discovered her adulteries. 
Lalage is also a model parent, 
Her offspring are fat and happy. 




The Picture 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The eyes of this dead lady speak to me, 
For here was love, was not to be drowned out. 
And here desire, not to be kissed away. 
The eyes of this dead lady speak to me. 




The Plunge 

I would bathe myself in strangeness: 
These comforts heaped upon me, smother me! 
I burn, I scald so for the new, 
New friends, new faces, 
Places! 
Oh to be out of this, 
This that is all I wanted 

-save the new. 
And you, 
Love, you the much, the more desired! 
Do I not loathe all walls, streets, stones, 
All mire, mist, all fog, 
All ways of traffic? 
You, I wold have flow over me like water, 
Oh, but far out of this! 
Grass, and low fields, and hills, 
And sun, 
Oh, sun enough! 
Out, and alone, among some 
Alien people! 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>



The Rest 

O helpless few in my country, remnant enslaved! 

Artists broken against her, 
A-stray, lost in the villages, 
Mistrusted, spoken-against, 

Lovers of beauty, starved, 
Thwarted with systems, 
Helpless against the control; 

You who can not wear yourselves out 
By persisting to successes, 
You who can only speak, 
Who can not steel yourselves into reiteration; 

You of the finer sense, 
Broken against false knowledge, 
You who can know at first hand, 
Hated, shut in, mistrusted: 

Take thought: 
I have weathered the storm, 
I have beaten out my exile. 




The Return 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
See, they return; ah, see the tentative 
Movements, and the slow feet, 
The trouble in the pace and the uncertain 
Wavering! 

See, they return, one by one, 
With fear, as half-awakened; 
As if the snow should hesitate 
And murmur in the wind, 
and half turn back; 
These were the "Wing'd-with-Awe," 
Inviolable. 

Gods of the Wingèd shoe! 
With them the silver hounds, 
sniffing the trace of air! 

Haie! Haie! 
These were the swift to harry; 
These the keen-scented; 
These were the souls of blood. 

Slow on the leash, 
pallid the leash-men!

The River Song 

This boat is of shato-wood, and its gunwales are cut 
magnolia, 
Musicians with jewelled flutes and with pipes of gold 
Fill full the sides in rows, and our wine 
Is rich for a thousand cups. 
We carry singing girls, drift with the drifting water, 
Yet Sennin needs 
A yellow stork for a charger, and all our seamen 
Would follow the white gulls or ride them. 
Kutsu's prose song 
Hangs with the sun and moon. 

King So's terraced palace 
is now but barren hill, 
But I draw pen on this barge 
Causing the five peaks to tremble, 
And I have joy in these words 
like the joy of blue islands. 
(If glory could last forever 
Then the waters of Han would flow northward.) 

And I have moped in the Emperor's garden, awaiting an 
order-to-write ! 
I looked at the dragon-pond, with its willow-coloured 
water 
Just reflecting the sky's tinge, 
And heard the five-score nightingales aimlessly singing. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

The eastern wind brings the green colour into the island 
grasses at Yei-shu, 
The purple house and the crimson are full of Spring 
softness. 
South of the pond the willow-tips are half-blue and 
bluer, 
Their cords tangle in mist, against the brocade-like 
palace. 
Vine-strings a hundred feet long hang down from 
carved railings, 
And high over the willows, the fine birds sing to each 



other, and listen, 
Crying—‘Kwan, Kuan,' for the early wind, and the feel 
of it. 
The wind bundles itself into a bluish cloud and wanders 
off. 
Over a thousand gates, over a thousand doors are the 
sounds of spring singing, 
And the Emperor is at Ko. 
Five clouds hang aloft, bright on the purple sky, 
The imperial guards come forth from the golden house 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
with their armour a-gleaming. 
The Emperor in his jewelled car goes out to inspect his 
flowers, 
He goes out to Hori, to look at the wing-flapping storks, 
He returns by way of Sei rock, to hear the new 
nightingales, 
For the gardens at Jo-run are full of new nightingales, 
Their sound is mixed in this flute, 
Their voice is in the twelve pipes here. 




The River-Merchant's Wife: A Letter 

After Li Po 

While my hair was still cut straight 
across my forehead 

I played at the front gate, pulling 
flowers. 

You came by on bamboo stilts, playing 
horse, 

You walked about my seat, playing with 
blue plums. 

And we went on living in the village of 
Chokan: 

Two small people, without dislike or 
suspicion. 

At fourteen I married My Lord you. 

I never laughed, being bashful. 

Lowering my head, I looked at the wall. 

Called to, a thousand times, I never 
looked back. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
At fifteen I stopped scowling, 

I desired my dust to be mingled with 
yours 

Forever and forever and forever. 

Why should I climb the lookout? 

At sixteen you departed, 

You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river 
of swirling eddies, 

And you have been gone five months. 

The monkeys make sorrowful noise 
overhead. 

You dragged your feet when you went 
out, 

By the gate now, the moss is grown, 
the different mosses, 

Too deep to clear them away! 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

The leaves fall early this autumn, in 
wind. 
The paired butterflies are already

 yellow with August 
Over the grass in the West garden; 
They hurt me. I grow older. 
If you are coming down through the

 narrows of the river Kiang, 
Please let me know beforehand, 
And I will come out to meet you 
As far as Cho-fu-sa. 


Anonymous submission. 




The Seafarer 

(From the early Anglo-Saxon text) 

May I for my own self song's truth reckon, 
Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days 
Hardship endured oft. 
Bitter breast-cares have I abided, 
Known on my keel many a care's hold, 
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent 
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head 
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted, 
My feet were by frost benumbed. 
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs 
Hew my heart round and hunger begot 
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not 
That he on dry land loveliest liveth, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea, 
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast 
Deprived of my kinsmen; 
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew, 
There I heard naught save the harsh sea 
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries, 
Did for my games the gannet's clamour, 
Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter, 
The mews' singing all my mead-drink. 
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern 
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed 
With spray on his pinion. 
Not any protector 
May make merry man faring needy. 
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life 
Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business, 
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft 
Must bide above brine. 
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north, 
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then 
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now 
The heart's thought that I on high streams 
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone. 
Moaneth alway my mind's lust 



That I fare forth, that I afar hence 
Seek out a foreign fastness. 
For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed; 
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful 
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare 
Whatever his lord will. 
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having 
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight 
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash, 
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water. 
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries, 
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker, 
All this admonisheth man eager of mood, 
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks 
On flood-ways to be far departing. 
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying, 
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow, 
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not -He 
the prosperous man -- what some perform 
Where wandering them widest draweth. 
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock, 
My mood 'mid the mere-flood, 
Over the whale's acre, would wander wide. 
On earth's shelter cometh oft to me, 
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer, 
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly, 
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow 
My lord deems to me this dead life 
On loan and on land, I believe not 
That any earth-weal eternal standeth 
Save there be somewhat calamitous 
That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain. 
Disease or oldness or sword-hate 
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body. 
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after -Laud 
of the living, boasteth some last word, 
That he will work ere he pass onward, 
Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice, 
Daring ado, ... 
So that all men shall honour him after 
And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English, 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast, 
Delight mid the doughty. 
Days little durable, 
And all arrogance of earthen riches, 
There come now no kings nor Cæsars 
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone. 
Howe'er in mirth most magnified, 
Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest, 
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable! 
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth. 
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low. 
Earthly glory ageth and seareth. 
No man at all going the earth's gait, 
But age fares against him, his face paleth, 
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions, 
Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven, 
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth, 
Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry, 
Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart, 
And though he strew the grave with gold, 
His born brothers, their buried bodies 
Be an unlikely treasure hoard. 




The Seeing Eye 

The small dogs look at the big dogs; 
They observe unwieldy dimensions 
And curious imperfections of odor. 
Here is the formal male group: 
The young men look upon their seniors, 
They consider the elderly mind 
And observe its inexplicable correlations. 

Said Tsin-Tsu: 
It is only in small dogs and the young 
That we find minute observation

The Social Order

This government official 
Whose wife is several years his senior, 
Has such a caressing air 
When he shakes hands with young ladies. 

II 
(Pompes Funèbres) 

This old lady, 
Who was fcso old that she was an atheist', 
Is now surrounded 
By six candles and a crucifix, 
While the second wife of a nephew 
Makes hay with the things in her house. 
Her two cats 
Go before her into Avernus; 
A sort of chloroformed suttee, 
And it is to be hoped that their spirits will walk 
With their tails up, 
And with a plaintive, gentle mewing, 
For it is certain that she has left on this earth 
No sound 
Save a squabble of female connections,

The Spring 

Cydonian Spring with her attendant train, 
Maelids and water-girls, 
Stepping beneath a boisterous wind from Thrace, 
Throughout this sylvan place 
Spreads the bright tips, 
And every vine-stock is 
Clad in new brilliancies. 
And wild desire 
Falls like black lightning. 
bewildered heart, 
Though every branch have back what last year lost, 
She, who moved here amid the cyclamen, 
Moves only now a clinging tenuous ghost. 




The Study In Aesthetics 

The very small children in patched clothing, 
Being smitten with an unusual wisdom, 
Stopped in their play as she passed them 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And cried up from their cobbles: 

Guarda! Ahi, guarda! Ch’ è be’ a! 

But three years after this 
I heard the young Dante, whose last name I do not 
know-For 
there are, in Sirmione, twenty-eight young Dantes 
and thirty-four Catulli; 
And there had been a great catch of sardines, 
And his elders 
Were packing them in the great wooden boxes 
For the market in Brescia, and he 
Leapt about, snatching at the bright fish 
And getting in both of their ways; 
And in vain they commanded him to stafermo! 
And when they would not let him arrange 
The fish in the boxes 
He stroked those which were already arranged, 
Murmuring for his own satisfaction 
This identical phrase: 

Ch’ è be’ a 

And at this I was mildly abashed. 




The Summons 

I can not bow to woo thee 
With honey words and flower kisses 
And the dew of sweet half-truths 
Fallen on the grass of old quaint love-tales 
Of broidered days foredone. 
Nor in the murmurous twilight 
May I sit below thee, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Worshiping in whispers 
Tremulous as far-heard bells. 
All these things have I known once 
And passed 
In that gay youth I had but yester-year. 
And that is gone 
As the shadow of wind. 
Nay, I can not woo thee thus; 
But as I am ever swept upward 
To the centre of all truth 
So must I bear thee with me 
Rapt into this great involving flame, 
Calling ever from the midst thereof, 
"Follow! Follow!" 
And in the glory of our meeting 
Shall the power be reborn. 
And together in the midst of this power 
Must we, each outstriving each, 
Cry eternally: 
"I come, go thou yet further." 
And again, "Follow," 
For we may not tarry. 




The Tea Shop 

The girl in the tea shop 
Is not so beautiful as she was, 
The August has worn against her. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
She does not get up the stairs so eagerly; 
Yes, she also will turn middle-aged, 
And the glow of youth that she spread about us 
As she brought us our muffins 
Will be spread about us no longer. 
She also will turn middle-aged. 




The Temperaments 

Nine adulteries, 12 liaisons, 64 fornications and 
something approaching a rape 
Rest nightly upon the soul of our delicate friend 
Florialis, 
And yet the man is so quiet and reserved in demeanour 
That he passes for both bloodless and sexless. 
Bastidides, on the contrary, who both talks and writes 
of nothing save copulation, 
Has become the father of twins, 
But he accomplished this feat at some cost; 
He had to be four times cuckold. 




The Three Poets 

Candidia has taken a new lover 
And three poets are gone into mourning. 
The first has written a long elegy to 'Chloris', 
To 'Chloris chaste and cold,' his 'only Chloris'. 
The second has written a sonnet 
upon the mutability of woman, 
And the third writes an epigram to Candidia. 




The Tomb At Akr Çaar 

‘I am thy soul, Nikoptis. I have watched 
These five millennia, and thy dead eyes 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Moved not, nor ever answer my desire, 
And thy light limbs, wherethrough I leapt aflame, 
Burn not with me nor any saffron thing. 

See, the light grass sprang up to pillow thee, 
And kissed thee with a myriad grassy tongues; 
But not thou me. 
I have read out the gold upon the wall, 
And wearied out my thought upon the signs. 
And there is no new thing in all this place. 

I have been kind. See, I have left the jars sealed, 
Lest thou shouldst wake and whimper for thy wine. 
And all thy robes I have kept smooth on thee. 

O thou unmindful ! How should I forget! 
-Even the river many days ago, 
The river? thou wast over young. 
And three souls came upon Thee-
And I came. 
And I flowed in upon thee, beat them off; 
1 have been intimate with thee, known thy ways. 
Have I not touched thy palms and finger-tips, 
Flowed in, and through thee and about thy heels? 
How 'came I in'? Was I not thee and Thee? 

And no sun comes to rest me in this place, 
And I am torn against the jagged dark, 
And no light beats upon me, and you say 
No word, day after day. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Oh! I could get me out, despite the marks 
And all their crafty work upon the door, 
Out through the glass-green fields. . . . 

Yet it is quiet here: 
I do not go.’ 






The Tree 

I stood still and was a tree amid the wood, 
Knowing the truth of things unseen before; 
Of Daphne and the laurel bow 
And that god-feasting couple old 
that grew elm-oak amid the wold. 
'Twas not until the gods had been 
Kindly entreated, and been brought within 
Unto the hearth of their heart's home 
That they might do this wonder thing; 
Nathless I have been a tree amid the wood 
And many a new thing understood 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That was rank folly to my head before. 




The White Stag 

I ha' seen them 'mid the clouds on the heather. 
Lo! they pause not for love nor for sorrow, 
Yet their eyes are as the eyes of a maid to her lover, 
When the white hart breaks his cover 
And the white wind breaks the morn. 

‘'Tis the white stag, Fame, we're a-hunting, 
Bid the world's hounds come to horn!’ 




These Fought In Any Case 

These fought in any case, 
and some believing 
pro domo, in any case ..... 

Died some, pro patria,

<|startoftext|>
walked eye-deep in hell 
believing in old men's lies, then unbelieving 
came home, home to a lie, 
home to many deceits, 
home to old lies and new infamy; 
usury age-old and age-thick 
and liars in public places. 

Daring as never before, wastage as never before. 
Young blood and high blood, 
fair cheeks, and fine bodies; 

fortitude as never before 

frankness as never before, 
disillusions as never told in the old days, 
hysterias, trench confessions, 
laughter out of dead bellies.

IN o more for us the little sighing. 
No more the winds at twilight trouble us.

Lo the fair dead! 

No more do I burn. 

No more for us the fluttering of wings 
That whirred in the air above us. 

Lo the fair dead! 

No more desire flayeth me, 
No more for us the trembling 
At the meeting of hands. 

Lo the fair dead! 

No more for us the wine of the lips, 
No more for us the knowledge. 
Lo the fair dead! 

No more the torrent, 
No more for us the meeting-place 
(Lo the fair dead!)

To Whistler, American 

On the loan exhibit of his paintings at the Tate Gallery. 

You also, our first great, 
Had tried all ways; 
Tested and pried and worked in many fashions, 
And this much gives me heart to play the game. 

Here is part that's slight, and part gone wrong, 
And much of little moment, and some few 
Perfect as Diirer! 
'In the Studio' and these two portraits, if I had my choice! 
And then these sketches in the mood of Greece? 

You had your searches, your uncertainties, 
And this is good to know for us, I mean, 
Who bear the brunt of our America 
And try to wrench her impulse into art. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

You were not always sure, not always set 
To hiding night or tuning ^symphonies'; 
Had not one style from birth, but tried and pried 
And stretched and tampered with the media. 

You and Abe Lincoln from that mass of dolts 
Show us there's chance at least of winning through. 




To-Em-Meps ‘the Unmoving Cloud' 

I 
The clouds have gathered, and gathered, 
and the rain falls and falls, 
The eight ply of the heavens 
are all folded into one darkness, 
And the wide, flat road stretches out. 
I stop in my room toward the East, quiet, quiet, 
I pat my new cask of wine. 
My friends are estranged, or far distant, 
I bow my head and stand still. 

II 
Rain, rain, and the clouds have gathered, 
The eight ply of the heavens are darkness, 
The flat land is turned into river. 
'Wine, wine, here is wine!' 
I drink by my eastern window. 
I think of talking and man, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And no boat, no carriage, approaches. 

III 
The trees in my east-looking garden 
are bursting out with new twigs, 
They try to stir new affection, 
And men say the sun and moon keep on moving 
because they can't find a soft seat. 
The birds flutter to rest in my tree, 
and I think I have heard them saying, 
'It is not that there are no other men 
But we like this fellow the best, 
But however we long to speak 
He can not know of our sorrow.' 




Translations And Adaptations From Heine 

FROM ‘DIE HEIMKEHR' 

I 
Is your hate, then, of such measure? 
Do you, truly, so detest me? 
Through all the world will I complain 
Of how you have addressed me. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

O ye lips that are ungrateful, 
Hath it never once distressed you, 
That you can say such awful things 
Of any one who ever kissed you? 

II 
So thou hast forgotten fully 
That I so long held thy heart wholly, 
Thy little heart, so sweet and false and small 
That there's no thing more sweet or false at all. 

Love and lay thou hast forgotten fully, 
And my heart worked at them unduly. 
I know not if the love or if the lay were better stuff, 
But I know now, they both were good enough. 

III 
Tell me where thy lovely love is, 
Whom thou once did sing so sweetly, 
When the fairy flames enshrouded 
Thee, and held thy heart completely. 

All the flames are dead and sped now 
And my heart is cold and sere; 
Behold this book, the urn of ashes, 
Tis my true love's sepulchre. 

IV 



I dreamt that I was God Himself 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Whom heavenly joy immerses, 
And all the angels sat about 
And praised my verses. 

V 
The mutilated choir boys 
When I begin to sing 
Complain about the awful noise 
And call my voice too thick a thing. 

When light their voices lift them up, 
Bright notes against the ear, 
Through trills and runs like crystal, 
Ring delicate and clear. 

They sing of Love that's grown desirous, 
Of Love, and joy that is Love's inmost part, 
And all the ladies swim through tears 
Toward such a work of art. 

VI 
This delightful young man 
Should not lack for honourers, 
He propitiates me with oysters, 
With Rhine wine and liqueurs. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
How his coat and pants adorn him! 
Yet his ties are more adorning, 
In these he daily comes to ask me: 
'Are you feeling well this morning?' 

He speaks of my extended fame, 
My wit, charm, definitions, 
And is diligent to serve me, 
Is detailed in his provisions. 

In evening company he sets his face 
In most spirituel positions, 
And declaims before the ladies 



My god-like compositions. 

what comfort is it for me 
To find him such, when the days bring 
No comfort, at my time of life when 
All good things go vanishing.

SONG FROM 'DIE HARZREISE' 
I am the Princess Ilza 
In Ilsenstein I fare, 
Come with me to that castle 
And we'll be happy there. 

Thy head will I cover over 
With my waves' clarity 
Till thou forget thy sorrow, 
wounded sorrowfully. 

Thou wilt in my white arms then 
Nay, on my breast thou must 
Forget and rest and dream there 
For thine old legend-lust. 

My lips and my heart are thine there 
As they were his and mine. 
His? Why the good King Harry's, 
And he is dead lang syne. 

Dead men stay alway dead men. 
Life is the live man's part, 
And I am fair and golden 
With joy breathless at heart. 



If my heart stay below there, 
My crystal halls ring clear 
To the dance of lords and ladies 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In all their splendid gear. 

The silken trains go rustling, 
The spur-clinks sound between, 
The dark dwarfs blow and bow there 
Small horn and violin. 

Yet shall my white arms hold thee, 
That bound King Harry about. 
Ah, I covered his ears with them 
When the trumpet rang out. 

VIII 
NIGHT SONG 
And have you thoroughly kissed my lips; 
There was no particular haste, 
And are you not ready when evening's come? 
There's no particular haste. 

You've got the whole night before you, 
Heart's-all-beloved-my-own; 
In an uninterrupted night one can 
Get a good deal of kissing done.

Villanelle: The Psychological Hour 

I had over prepared the event, 
that much was ominous. 
With middle-ageing care 
I had laid out just the right books. 
I had almost turned down the pages. 

Beauty is so rare a thing. 
So few drink of my fountain. 

So much barren regret, 
So many hours wasted! 
And now I watch, from the window, 
the rain, the wandering busses. 

"Their little cosmos is shaken" the 
air is alive with that fact. 
In their parts of the city 
they are played on by diverse forces. 
How do I know? 
Oh, I know well enough. 
For them there is something afoot. 
As for me; 
I had over-prepared the event 


Beauty is so rare a thing. 
So few drink of my fountain. 

Two friends: a breath of the forest. . . 
Friends? Are people less friends 
because one has just, at last, found them?

"Between the night and the morning?" 
Beauty would drink of my mind. 
Youth would awhile forget 
my youth is gone from me. 

(Speak up! You have danced so stiffly? 



Someone admired your works, 
And said so frankly. 

"Did you talk like a fool, 
The first night? 
The second evening?" 

"But they promised again: 
'To-morrow at tea-time'.") 

Now the third day is here no 
word from either; 
No word from her nor him, 
Only another man's note: 
"Dear Pound, I am leaving England." 




Villonaud For This Yule 

Towards the Noel that morte saison 
<i>(Christ make the shepherds' homage dear!)</i> 
Then when the grey wolves everychone 
Drink of the winds their chill small-beer 
And lap o' the snows food's gueredon 
Then makyth my heart his yule-tide cheer 
<i>(Skoal! with the dregs if the clear be gone!)</i> 
Wineing the ghosts of yester-year. 

Ask ye what ghost I dream upon? 
<i>(What of the magians' scented gear?)</i> 
The ghosts of dead loves everyone 
That make the stark winds reek with fear 
Lest love return with the foison sun 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And slay the memories that me cheer 
<i>(Such as I drink to mine fashion)</i> 
Wineing the ghosts of yester-year. 

Where are the joys my heart had won? 
<i>(Saturn and Mars to Zeus drawn near!)</i> 
Where are athe lips mine lay upon, 
Aye! where are the glances feat and clear 
That bade my heart his valor don? 

I skoal to the eyes as grey-blown meer 
<i>(Who knows whose was that paragon?)</i> 
Wineing the ghosts of yester-year. 

Prince: ask me not what I have done 
Nor what God hath that can me cheer 
But ye ask first where the winds are gone 
Wineing the ghosts of yester-year. 




Women Before A Shop 

The gew-gaws of false amber and false turquoise attract them. 
'Like to like nature': these agglutinous yellows! 




Yeux Glauques 

Gladstone was still respected, 
When John Ruskin produced 
'King's Treasuries'; Swinburne 
And Rossetti still abused. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Foetid Buchanan lifted up his voice 
When that faun's head of hers 
Became a pastime for 
Painters and adulterers. 

The Burne-Jones cartons 
Have preserved her eyes; 
Still, at the Tate, they teach 
Cophetua to rhapsodize; 

Thin like brook-water, 
With a vacant gaze. 
The English Rubaiyat was still-born 
In those days. 

The thin, clear gaze, the same 
Still darts out faun-like from the half-ruin'd face, 
Questing and passive. . . . 
;Ah, poor Jenny's case' . . . 

Bewildered that a world 
Shows no surprise 
At her last maquero's 
Adulteries. 




A Bronzeville Mother Loiters In Mississippi. Meanwhile, 
A Mississippi Mother Burns Bacon 

From the first it had been like a 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Ballad. It had the beat inevitable. It had the blood. 
A wildness cut up, and tied in little bunches, 
Like the four-line stanzas of the ballads she had never quite 
understood--the ballads they had set her to, in school. 

Herself: the milk-white maid, the "maid mild" 
Of the ballad. Pursued 
By the Dark Villain. Rescued by the Fine Prince. 
The Happiness-Ever-After. 
That was worth anything. 
It was good to be a "maid mild." 
That made the breath go fast. 

Her bacon burned. She 
Hastened to hide it in the step-on can, and 
Drew more strips from the meat case. The eggs and sour-milk biscuits 
Did well. She set out a jar 
Of her new quince preserve. 

. . . But there was something about the matter of the Dark Villain. 
He should have been older, perhaps. 
The hacking down of a villain was more fun to think about 
When his menace possessed undisputed breath, undisputed height, 
And best of all, when history was cluttered 
With the bones of many eaten knights and princesses. 

The fun was disturbed, then all but nullified 
When the Dark Villain was a blackish child 
Of Fourteen, with eyes still too young to be dirty, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And a mouth too young to have lost every reminder 
Of its infant softness. 



That boy must have been surprised! For 
These were grown-ups. Grown-ups were supposed to be wise. 
And the Fine Prince--and that other--so tall, so broad, so 
Grown! Perhaps the boy had never guessed 
That the trouble with grown-ups was that under the magnificent shell of 
adulthood, just under, 
Waited the baby full of tantrums. 
It occurred to her that there may have been something 
Ridiculous to the picture of the Fine Prince 
Rushing (rich with the breadth and height and 
Mature solidness whose lack, in the Dark Villain, was impressing her, 
Confronting her more and more as this first day after the trial 
And acquittal (wore on) rushing 
With his heavy companion to hack down (unhorsed) 
That little foe. So much had happened, she could not remember now what that 
foe had done 
Against her, or if anything had been done. 
The breaks were everywhere. That she could think 
Of no thread capable of the necessary 
Sew-work. 

She made the babies sit in their places at the table. 
Then, before calling HIM, she hurried 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To the mirror with her comb and lipstick. It was necessary 
To be more beautiful than ever. 
The beautiful wife. 
For sometimes she fancied he looked at her as though 
Measuring her. As if he considered, Had she been worth it? 
Had she been worth the blood, the cramped cries, the little stirring bravado, The 
gradual dulling of those Negro eyes, 
The sudden, overwhelming little-boyness in that barn? 
Whatever she might feel or half-feel, the lipstick necessity was something apart. 
HE must never conclude 
That she had not been worth it. 

HE sat down, the Fine Prince, and 
Began buttering a biscuit. HE looked at HIS hands. 
More papers were in from the North, HE mumbled. More maddening headlines. 
With their pepper-words, "bestiality," and "barbarism," and 



"Shocking." 
The half-sneers HE had mastered for the trial worked across 
HIS sweet and pretty face. 

What HE'd like to do, HE explained, was kill them all. 
The time lost. The unwanted fame. 
Still, it had been fun to show those intruders 
A thing or two. To show that snappy-eyed mother, 
That sassy, Northern, brown-black-


Nothing could stop Mississippi. 
HE knew that. Big fella 
Knew that. 
And, what was so good, Mississippi knew that. 
They could send in their petitions, and scar 
Their newspapers with bleeding headlines. Their governors 
Could appeal to Washington . . . 

"What I want," the older baby said, "is 'lasses on my jam." 
Whereupon the younger baby 
Picked up the molasses pitcher and threw 
The molasses in his brother's face. Instantly 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The Fine Prince leaned across the table and slapped 
The small and smiling criminal. 
She did not speak. When the HAND 
Came down and away, and she could look at her child, 
At her baby-child, 
She could think only of blood. 
Surely her baby's cheek 
Had disappeared, and in its place, surely, 
Hung a heaviness, a lengthening red, a red that had no end. 
She shook her had. It was not true, of course. 
It was not true at all. The 
Child's face was as always, the 
Color of the paste in her paste-jar. 

She left the table, to the tune of the children's lamentations, which were shriller 
Than ever. She 



Looked out of a window. She said not a word. That 
Was one of the new Somethings-The 
fear, 
Tying her as with iron. 

Suddenly she felt his hands upon her. He had followed her 
To the window. The children were whimpering now. 
Such bits of tots. And she, their mother, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Could not protect them. She looked at her shoulders, still 
Gripped in the claim of his hands. She tried, but could not resist the idea 
That a red ooze was seeping, spreading darkly, thickly, slowly, 
Over her white shoulders, her own shoulders, 
And over all of Earth and Mars. 

He whispered something to her, did the Fine Prince, something about love and 
night and intention. 
She heard no hoof-beat of the horse and saw no flash of the shining steel. 

He pulled her face around to meet 
His, and there it was, close close, 
For the first time in all the days and nights. 
His mouth, wet and red, 
So very, very, very red, 
Closed over hers. 

Then a sickness heaved within her. The courtroom Coca-Cola, 
The courtroom beer and hate and sweat and drone, 
Pushed like a wall against her. She wanted to bear it. 
But his mouth would not go away and neither would the 
Decapitated exclamation points in that Other Woman's eyes. 

She did not scream. 
She stood there. 
But a hatred for him burst into glorious flower, 
And its perfume enclasped them--big, 
Bigger than all magnolias. 



The last bleak news of the ballad. 
The rest of the rugged music. 
The last quatrain.

A Penitent Considers Another Coming Of Mary

 For Reverend Theodore Richardson 

If Mary came would Mary 
Forgive, as Mothers may, 
And sad and second Saviour 
Furnish us today? 

She would not shake her head and leave 
This military air, 
But ratify a modern hay, 
And put her Baby there. 

Mary would not punish men— 
If Mary came again. 




A Song In The Front Yard 

I’ve stayed in the front yard all my life. 
I want a peek at the back 
Where it’s rough and untended and hungry weed grows. 
A girl gets sick of a rose. 

I want to go in the back yard now 
And maybe down the alley, 
To where the charity children play. 
I want a good time today. 

They do some wonderful things. 
They have some wonderful fun. 
My mother sneers, but I say it’s fine 
How they don’t have to go in at quarter to nine. 
My mother, she tells me that Johnnie Mae 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Will grow up to be a bad woman. 
That George’ll be taken to Jail soon or late 
(On account of last winter he sold our back gate). 

But I say it’s fine. Honest, I do. 
And I’d like to be a bad woman, too, 
And wear the brave stockings of night-black lace 
And strut down the streets with paint on my face. 




A Sunset Of The City 

Already I am no longer looked at with lechery or love. 
My daughters and sons have put me away with marbles and dolls, 
Are gone from the house. 
My husband and lovers are pleasant or somewhat polite 
And night is night. 

It is a real chill out, 
The genuine thing. 
I am not deceived, I do not think it is still summer 
Because sun stays and birds continue to sing. 

It is summer-gone that I see, it is summer-gone. 
The sweet flowers indrying and dying down, 
The grasses forgetting their blaze and consenting to brown. 

It is a real chill out. The fall crisp comes 
I am aware there is winter to heed. 
There is no warm house 
That is fitted with my need. 

I am cold in this cold house this house 
Whose washed echoes are tremulous down lost halls. 
I am a woman, and dusty, standing among new affairs. 
I am a woman who hurries through her prayers. 

Tin intimations of a quiet core to be my 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Desert and my dear relief 
Come: there shall be such islanding from grief, 
And small communion with the master shore. 
Twang they. And I incline this ear to tin, 
Consult a dual dilemma. Whether to dry 
In humming pallor or to leap and die. 

Somebody muffed it?? Somebody wanted to joke. 




Boy Breaking Glass 

To Marc Crawford 
from whom the commission 
Whose broken window is a cry of art 
(success, that winks aware 
as elegance, as a treasonable faith) 
is raw: is sonic: is old-eyed première. 
Our beautiful flaw and terrible ornament. 
Our barbarous and metal little man. 

“I shall create! If not a note, a hole. 
If not an overture, a desecration.” 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Full of pepper and light 
and Salt and night and cargoes. 

“Don’t go down the plank 
if you see there’s no extension. 
Each to his grief, each to 
his loneliness and fidgety revenge. 
Nobody knew where I was and now I am no longer there.” 

The only sanity is a cup of tea. 
The music is in minors. 

Each one other 
is having different weather. 

“It was you, it was you who threw away my name! 
And this is everything I have for me.” 

Who has not Congress, lobster, love, luau, 
the Regency Room, the Statue of Liberty, 
runs. A sloppy amalgamation. 
A mistake. 
A cliff. 
A hymn, a snare, and an exceeding sun. 




Garbageman: The Man With The Orderly Mind 

What do you think of us in fuzzy endeavor, you whose directions are 
sterling, whose lunge is straight? 
Can you make a reason, how can you pardon us who memorize the rules and 

never score? 

Who memorize the rules from your own text but never quite transfer them to the 
game, 
Who never quite receive the whistling ball, who gawk, begin to absorb the 

crowd's own roar. 

Is earnest enough, may earnest attract or lead to light; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Is light enough, if hands in clumsy frenzy, flimsy whimsically, enlist; 
Is light enough when this bewilderment crying against the dark shuts down the 

shades? 
Dilute confusion. Find and explode our mist. 



Jessie Mitchell’s Mother 

Into her mother’s bedroom to wash the ballooning body. 
“My mother is jelly-hearted and she has a brain of jelly: 
Sweet, quiver-soft, irrelevant. Not essential. 
Only a habit would cry if she should die. 
A pleasant sort of fool without the least iron. . . . 
Are you better, mother, do you think it will come today?” 
The stretched yellow rag that was Jessie Mitchell’s mother 
Reviewed her. Young, and so thin, and so straight. 
So straight! as if nothing could ever bend her. 
But poor men would bend her, and doing things with poor men, 
Being much in bed, and babies would bend her over, 
And the rest of things in life that were for poor women, 
Coming to them grinning and pretty with intent to bend and to kill. 
Comparisons shattered her heart, ate at her bulwarks: 
The shabby and the bright: she, almost hating her daughter, 
Crept into an old sly refuge: “Jessie’s black 
And her way will be black, and jerkier even than mine. 
Mine, in fact, because I was lovely, had flowers 
Tucked in the jerks, flowers were here and there. . . .” 
She revived for the moment settled and dried-up triumphs, 
Forced perfume into old petals, pulled up the droop, 
Refueled 
Triumphant long-exhaled breaths. 
Her exquisite yellow youth . . .

Kitchenette Building 

We are things of dry hours and the involuntary plan, 
Grayed in, and gray. "Dream" mate, a giddy sound, not strong 
Like "rent", "feeding a wife", "satisfying a man". 

But could a dream sent up through onion fumes 
Its white and violet, fight with fried potatoes 
And yesterday's garbage ripening in the hall, 
Flutter, or sing an aria down these rooms, 

Even if we were willing to let it in, 
Had time to warm it, keep it very clean, 
Anticipate a message, let it begin? 

We wonder. But not well! not for a minute! 
Since Number Five is out of the bathroom now, 
We think of lukewarm water, hope to get in it.

My Dreams, My Works, Must Wait Till After Hell 

I hold my honey and I store my bread 
In little jars and cabinets of my will. 
I label clearly, and each latch and lid 
I bid, Be firm till I return from hell. 
I am very hungry. I am incomplete. 
And none can give me any word but Wait, 
The puny light. I keep my eyes pointed in; 
Hoping that, when the devil days of my hurt 
Drag out to their last dregs and I resume 
On such legs as are left me, in such heart 
As I can manage, remember to go home, 
My taste will not have turned insensitive 
To honey and bread old purity could love. 




Of De Witt Williams On His Way To Lincoln Cemetery 

He was born in Alabama. 
He was bred in Illinois. 
He was nothing but a 
Plain black boy. 

Swing low swing low sweet sweet chariot. 
Nothing but a plain black boy. 

Drive him past the Pool Hall. 
Drive him past the Show. 
Blind within his casket, 
But maybe he will know. 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Down through Forty-seventh Street: 
Underneath the L, 
And Northwest Corner, Prairie, 
That he loved so well. 

Don’t forget the Dance Halls— 
Warwick and Savoy, 
Where he picked his women, where 
He drank his liquid joy. 

Born in Alabama. 
Bred in Illinois. 
He was nothing but a 
Plain black boy. 

Swing low swing low sweet sweet chariot. 
Nothing but a plain black boy. 




Of Robert Frost 

There is a little lightning in his eyes. 
Iron at the mouth. 
His brows ride neither too far up nor down. 

He is splendid. With a place to stand. 

Some glowing in the common blood. 
Some specialness within.

One Wants A Teller In A Time Like This 

One wants a teller in a time like this 

One's not a man, one's not a woman grown 
To bear enormous business all alone. 

One cannot walk this winding street with pride 
Straight-shouldered, tranquil-eyed, 
Knowing one knows for sure the way back home. 
One wonders if one has a home. 

One is not certain if or why or how. 
One wants a Teller now: 

Put on your rubbers and you won't catch a cold 
Here's hell, there's heaven. Go to Sunday School 
Be patient, time brings all good things-(and cool 
Stong balm to calm the burning at the brain?) 
Behold, 
Love's true, and triumphs; and God's actual. 




Primer For Blacks 

Blackness 
is a title, 
is a preoccupation, 
is a commitment Blacks 
are to comprehend— 
and in which you are 
to perceive your Glory. 

The conscious shout 
of all that is white is 
“It’s Great to be white.” 
The conscious shout 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
of the slack in Black is 
'It's Great to be white.' 
Thus all that is white 
has white strength and yours. 

The word Black 

has geographic power, 

pulls everybody in: 

Blacks here— 

Blacks there— 

Blacks wherever they may be. 

And remember, you Blacks, what they told you— 

remember your Education: 

“one Drop—one Drop 

maketh a brand new Black.” 
Oh mighty Drop. 

______And because they have given us kindly 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

so many more of our people 

Blackness 
stretches over the land. 
Blackness— 
the Black of it, 
the rust-red of it, 
the milk and cream of it, 
the tan and yellow-tan of it, 
the deep-brown middle-brown high-brown of it, 



the “olive” and ochre of it— 
Blackness 
marches on. 

The huge, the pungent object of our prime out-ride 
is to Comprehend, 
to salute and to Love the fact that we are Black, 
which is our “ultimate Reality,” 
which is the lone ground 
from which our meaningful metamorphosis, 
from which our prosperous staccato, 
group or individual, can rise. 

Self-shriveled Blacks. 
Begin with gaunt and marvelous concession: 
YOU are our costume and our fundamental bone.

 All of you— 
you COLORED ones, 
you NEGRO ones, 

those of you who proudly cry 
“I’m half INDian”— 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
those of you who proudly screech 
“I’VE got the blood of George WASHington in MY veins” 
ALL of you—

 you proper Blacks, 
you half-Blacks, 
you wish-I-weren’t Blacks, 
Niggeroes and Niggerenes.

 You. 




Riot

 A riot is the language of the unheard. 
—martin luther king 

John Cabot, out of Wilma, once a Wycliffe, 
all whitebluerose below his golden hair, 
wrapped richly in right linen and right wool, 
almost forgot his Jaguar and Lake Bluff; 
almost forgot Grandtully (which is The 
Best Thing That Ever Happened To Scotch); almost 
forgot the sculpture at the Richard Gray 
and Distelheim; the kidney pie at Maxim’s, 
the Grenadine de Boeuf at Maison Henri. 

Because the Negroes were coming down the street. 

Because the Poor were sweaty and unpretty 
(not like Two Dainty Negroes in Winnetka) 
and they were coming toward him in rough ranks. 
In seas. In windsweep. They were black and loud. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And not detainable. And not discreet. 

Gross. Gross. “Que tu es grossier!” John Cabot 
itched instantly beneath the nourished white 
that told his story of glory to the World. 
“Don’t let It touch me! the blackness! Lord!” he whispered 
to any handy angel in the sky. 
But, in a thrilling announcement, on It drove 
and breathed on him: and touched him. In that breath 
the fume of pig foot, chitterling and cheap chili, 
malign, mocked John. And, in terrific touch, old 
averted doubt jerked forward decently, 
cried, “Cabot! John! You are a desperate man, 
and the desperate die expensively today.” 

John Cabot went down in the smoke and fire 
and broken glass and blood, and he cried “Lord! 
Forgive these nigguhs that know not what they do.” 






Sadie And Maud 

Maud went to college. 
Sadie stayed home. 
Sadie scraped life 
With a fine toothed comb. 

She didn't leave a tangle in 
Her comb found every strand. 
Sadie was one of the livingest chicks 
In all the land. 

Sadie bore two babies 
Under her maiden name. 
Maud and Ma and Papa 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Nearly died of shame. 

When Sadie said her last so-long 
Her girls struck out from home. 
(Sadie left as heritage 
Her fine-toothed comb.) 

Maud, who went to college, 
Is a thin brown mouse. 
She is living all alone 
In this old house. 




Speech To The Young : Speech To The Progress-
Toward 

Say to them, 
say to the down-keepers, 
the sun-slappers, 
the self-soilers, 
the harmony-hushers, 
"even if you are not ready for day 
it cannot always be night." 
You will be right. 
For that is the hard home-run. 

Live not for battles won. 
Live not for the-end-of-the-song. 
Live in the along.

The Ballad Of Rudolph Reed 

Rudolph Reed was oaken. 
His wife was oaken too. 
And his two good girls and his good little man 
Oakened as they grew. 

"I am not hungry for berries. 
I am not hungry for bread. 
But hungry hungry for a house 
Where at night a man in bed 

"May never hear the plaster 
Stir as if in pain. 
May never hear the roaches 
Falling like fat rain. 

"Where never wife and children need 
Go blinking through the gloom. 
Where every room of many rooms 
Will be full of room. 

"Oh my home may have its east or west 
Or north or south behind it. 
All I know is I shall know it, 
And fight for it when I find it." 

The agent's steep and steady stare 
Corroded to a grin. 
Why you black old, tough old hell of a man, 
Move your family in! 

Nary a grin grinned Rudolph Reed, 
Nary a curse cursed he, 
But moved in his House. With his dark little wife, 
And his dark little children three. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

A neighbor would look, with a yawning eye 
That squeezed into a slit. 
But the Rudolph Reeds and children three 
Were too joyous to notice it. 



For were they not firm in a home of their own 
With windows everywhere 
And a beautiful banistered stair 
And a front yard for flowers and a back for grass? 

The first night, a rock, big as two fists. 
The second, a rock big as three. 
But nary a curse cursed Rudolph Reed. 
(Though oaken as man could be.) 

The third night, a silvery ring of glass. 
Patience arched to endure, 
But he looked, and lo! small Mabel's blood 
Was staining her gaze so pure. 

Then up did rise our Roodoplh Reed 
And pressed the hand of his wife, 
And went to the door with a thirty-four 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And a beastly butcher knife. 

He ran like a mad thing into the night 
And the words in his mouth were stinking. 
By the time he had hurt his first white man 
He was no longer thinking. 

By the time he had hurt his fourth white man 
Rudolph Reed was dead. 
His neighbors gathered and kicked his corpse. 
"Nigger--" his neighbors said. 

Small Mabel whimpered all night long, 
For calling herself the cause. 
Her oak-eyed mother did no thing 
But change the bloody gauze. 




The Bean Eaters 

They eat beans mostly, this old yellow pair. 
Dinner is a casual affair. 
Plain chipware on a plain and creaking wood, 
Tin flatware. 

Two who are Mostly Good. 
Two who have lived their day, 
But keep on putting on their clothes 
And putting things away. 

And remembering . . . 
Remembering, with twinklings and twinges, 
As they lean over the beans in their rented back room that 
is full of beads and receipts and dolls and cloths, 
tobacco crumbs, vases and fringes. 




The Blackstone Rangers 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I 
AS SEEN BY DISCIPLINES 

There they are. 
Thirty at the corner. 
Black, raw, ready. 
Sores in the city 
that do not want to heal. 

II 
THE LEADERS 

Jeff. Gene. Geronimo. And Bop. 
They cancel, cure and curry. 
Hardly the dupes of the downtown thing 
the cold bonbon, 
the rhinestone thing. And hardly 
in a hurry. 
Hardly Belafonte, King, 
Black Jesus, Stokely, Malcolm X or Rap. 
Bungled trophies. 
Their country is a Nation on no map. 

Jeff, Gene, Geronimo and Bop 
in the passionate noon, 
in bewitching night 
are the detailed men, the copious men. 
They curry, cure, 
they cancel, cancelled images whose Concerts 
are not divine, vivacious; the different tins 
are intense last entries; pagan argument; 
translations of the night. 

The Blackstone bitter bureaus 
(bureaucracy is footloose) edit, fuse 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


unfashionable damnations and descent; 
and exulting, monstrous hand on monstrous hand, 
construct, strangely, a monstrous pearl or grace.

GANG GIRLS 

A Rangerette 

Gang Girls are sweet exotics. 
Mary Ann 
uses the nutrients of her orient, 
but sometimes sighs for Cities of blue and jewel 
beyond her Ranger rim of Cottage Grove. 
(Bowery Boys, Disciples, Whip-Birds will 
dissolve no margins, stop no savory sanctities.) 

Mary is 
a rose in a whiskey glass. 

Mary’s 
Februaries shudder and are gone. Aprils 
fret frankly, lilac hurries on. 
Summer is a hard irregular ridge. 
October looks away. 
And that’s the Year!

 Save for her bugle-love. 
Save for the bleat of not-obese devotion. 
Save for Somebody Terribly Dying, under 
the philanthropy of robins. Save for her Ranger 
bringing 
an amount of rainbow in a string-drawn bag.

“Where did you get the diamond?” Do not ask: 
but swallow, straight, the spirals of his flask 
and assist him at your zipper; pet his lips 
and help him clutch you. 

Love’s another departure. 
Will there be any arrivals, confirmations? 



Will there be gleaning? 

Mary, the Shakedancer’s child 
from the rooming-flat, pants carefully, peers at 
her laboring lover ....

 Mary! Mary Ann! 
Settle for sandwiches! settle for stocking caps! 
for sudden blood, aborted carnival, 
the props and niceties of non-loneliness— 
the rhymes of Leaning. 




The Children Of The Poor 

1 

People who have no children can be hard: 
Attain a mail of ice and insolence: 
Need not pause in the fire, and in no sense 
Hesitate in the hurricane to guard. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And when wide world is bitten and bewarred 
They perish purely, waving their spirits hence 
Without a trace of grace or of offense 
To laugh or fail, diffident, wonder-starred. 
While through a throttling dark we others hear 
The little lifting helplessness, the queer 
Whimper-whine; whose unridiculous 
Lost softness softly makes a trap for us. 
And makes a curse. And makes a sugar of 
The malocclusions, the inconditions of love. 

2 

What shall I give my children? who are poor, 
Who are adjudged the leastwise of the land, 
Who are my sweetest lepers, who demand 
No velvet and no velvety velour; 
But who have begged me for a brisk contour, 
Crying that they are quasi, contraband 
Because unfinished, graven by a hand 
Less than angelic, admirable or sure. 
My hand is stuffed with mode, design, device. 
But I lack access to my proper stone. 
And plenitude of plan shall not suffice 
Nor grief nor love shall be enough alone 
To ratify my little halves who bear 
Across an autumn freezing everywhere. 

3 

And shall I prime my children, pray, to pray? 
Mites, come invade most frugal vestibules 
Spectered with crusts of penitents’ renewals 



And all hysterics arrogant for a day. 
Instruct yourselves here is no devil to pay. 
Children, confine your lights in jellied rules; 
Resemble graves; be metaphysical mules. 
Learn Lord will not distort nor leave the fray. 
Behind the scurryings of your neat motif 
I shall wait, if you wish: revise the psalm 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
If that should frighten you: sew up belief 
If that should tear: turn, singularly calm 
At forehead and at fingers rather wise, 
Holding the bandage ready for your eyes. 




The Crazy Woman 

I shall not sing a May song. 
A May song should be gay. 
I'll wait until November 
And sing a song of gray. 

I'll wait until November 
That is the time for me. 
I'll go out in the frosty dark 
And sing most terribly. 

And all the little people 
Will stare at me and say, 
"That is the Crazy Woman 
Who would not sing in May." 

Anonymous submission. 




The Good Man 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The good man. 
He is still enhancer, renouncer. 
In the time of detachment, 
in the time of the vivid heather and affectionate evil, 
in the time of oral 
grave grave legalities of hate - all real 
walks our prime registered reproach and seal. 
Our successful moral. 
The good man. 

Watches our bogus roses, our rank wreath, our 
love's unreliable cement, the gray 
jubilees of our demondom. 
Coherent 
Counsel! Good man. 
Require of us our terribly excluded blue. 
Constrain, repair a ripped, revolted land. 
Put hand in hand land over. 
Reprove 
the abler droughts and manias of the day 
and a felicity entreat. 
Love. 
Complete 
your pledges, reinforce your aides, renew 
stance, testament.

The Independent Man 

Now who could take you off to tiny life 
In one room or in two rooms or in three 
And cork you smartly, like the flask of wine 
You are? Not any woman. Not a wife. 
You'd let her twirl you, give her a good glee 
Showing your leaping ruby to a friend. 
Though twirling would be meek. Since not a cork 
Could you allow, for being made so free. 

A woman would be wise to think it well 
If once a week you only rang the bell. 




The Life Of Lincoln West 

Ugliest little boy 
that everyone ever saw. 
That is what everyone said. 

Even to his mother it was apparent— 
when the blue-aproned nurse came into the 
northeast end of the maternity ward 
bearing his squeals and plump bottom 
looped up in a scant receiving blanket, 
bending, to pass the bundle carefully 
into the waiting mother-hands—that this 
was no cute little ugliness, no sly baby waywardness 
that was going to inch away 
as would baby fat, baby curl, and 
baby spot-rash. The pendulous lip, the 
branching ears, the eyes so wide and wild, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
the vague unvibrant brown of the skin, 
and, most disturbing, the great head. 
These components of That Look bespoke 
the sure fibre. The deep grain. 

His father could not bear the sight of him. 
His mother high-piled her pretty dyed hair and 
put him among her hairpins and sweethearts, 
dance slippers, torn paper roses. 
He was not less than these, 
he was not more. 

As the little Lincoln grew, 
uglily upward and out, he began 
to understand that something was 
wrong. His little ways of trying 
to please his father, the bringing 
of matches, the jumping aside at 
warning sound of oh-so-large and 
rushing stride, the smile that gave 
and gave and gave—Unsuccessful! 

Even Christmases and Easters were spoiled. 



He would be sitting at the 
family feasting table, really 
delighting in the displays of mashed potatoes 
and the rich golden 
fat-crust of the ham or the festive 
fowl, when he would look up and find 
somebody feeling indignant about him. 

What a pity what a pity. No love 
for one so loving. The little Lincoln 
loved Everybody. Ants. The changing 
caterpillar. His much-missing mother. 
His kindergarten teacher. 

His kindergarten teacher—whose 
concern for him was composed of one 
part sympathy and two parts repulsion. 
The others ran up with their little drawings. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
He ran up with his. 
She 
tried to be as pleasant with him as 
with others, but it was difficult. 
For she was all pretty! all daintiness, 
all tiny vanilla, with blue eyes and fluffy 
sun-hair. One afternoon she 
saw him in the hall looking bleak against 
the wall. It was strange because the 
bell had long since rung and no other 
child was in sight. Pity flooded her. 
She buttoned her gloves and suggested 
cheerfully that she walk him home. She 
started out bravely, holding him by the 
hand. But she had not walked far before 
she regretted it. The little monkey. 
Must everyone look? And clutching her 
hand like that. . . . Literally pinching 
it. . . . 

At seven, the little Lincoln loved 
the brother and sister who 
moved next door. Handsome. Well-
dressed. Charitable, often, to him. They 



enjoyed him because he was 
resourceful, made up 
games, told stories. But when 
their More Acceptable friends came they turned 
their handsome backs on him. He 
hated himself for his feeling 
of well-being when with them despite— 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Everything. 

He spent much time looking at himself 
in mirrors. What could be done? 
But there was no 
shrinking his head. There was no 
binding his ears. 

“Don’t touch me!” cried the little 
fairy-like being in the playground. 

Her name was Nerissa. The many 
children were playing tag, but when 
he caught her, she recoiled, jerked free 
and ran. It was like all the 
rainbow that ever was, going off 
forever, all, all the sparklings in 
the sunset west. 

One day, while he was yet seven, 
a thing happened. In the down-town movies 
with his mother a white 
man in the seat beside him whispered 
loudly to a companion, and pointed at 
the little Linc. 
“THERE! That’s the kind I’ve been wanting 
to show you! One of the best 
examples of the specie. Not like 
those diluted Negroes you see so much of on 
the streets these days, but the 
real thing. 

Black, ugly, and odd. You 
can see the savagery. The blunt 
blankness. That is the real 



thing.” 

His mother—her hair had never looked so 
red around the dark brown 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
velvet of her face—jumped up, 
shrieked “Go to—” She did not finish. 
She yanked to his feet the little 
Lincoln, who was sitting there 
staring in fascination at his assessor. At the author of his 
new idea. 

All the way home he was happy. Of course, 
he had not liked the word 
“ugly.” 
But, after all, should he not 
be used to that by now? What had 
struck him, among words and meanings 
he could little understand, was the phrase 
“the real thing.” 
He didn’t know quite why, 
but he liked that. 
He liked that very much. 

When he was hurt, too much 
stared at— 
too much 
left alone—he 
thought about that. He told himself 
“After all, I’m 
the real thing.” 

It comforted him. 




The Lovers Of The Poor 

arrive. The Ladies from the Ladies' Betterment League 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Arrive in the afternoon, the late light slanting 
In diluted gold bars across the boulevard brag 
Of proud, seamed faces with mercy and murder hinting 
Here, there, interrupting, all deep and debonair, 
The pink paint on the innocence of fear; 
Walk in a gingerly manner up the hall. 
Cutting with knives served by their softest care, 
Served by their love, so barbarously fair. 
Whose mothers taught: You'd better not be cruel! 
You had better not throw stones upon the wrens! 
Herein they kiss and coddle and assault 
Anew and dearly in the innocence 
With which they baffle nature. Who are full, 
Sleek, tender-clad, fit, fiftyish, a-glow, all 
Sweetly abortive, hinting at fat fruit, 
Judge it high time that fiftyish fingers felt 
Beneath the lovelier planes of enterprise. 
To resurrect. To moisten with milky chill. 
To be a random hitching-post or plush. 
To be, for wet eyes, random and handy hem. 
Their guild is giving money to the poor. 
The worthy poor. The very very worthy 
And beautiful poor. Perhaps just not too swarthy? 
perhaps just not too dirty nor too dim 
Nor--passionate. In truth, what they could wish 
Is--something less than derelict or dull. 
Not staunch enough to stab, though, gaze for gaze! 
God shield them sharply from the beggar-bold! 
The noxious needy ones whose battle's bald 
Nonetheless for being voiceless, hits one down. 
But it's all so bad! and entirely too much for them. 
The stench; the urine, cabbage, and dead beans, 
Dead porridges of assorted dusty grains, 
The old smoke, heavy diapers, and, they're told, 
Something called chitterlings. The darkness. Drawn 
Darkness, or dirty light. The soil that stirs. 
The soil that looks the soil of centuries. 
And for that matter the general oldness. Old 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

Wood. Old marble. Old tile. Old old old. 
Not homekind Oldness! Not Lake Forest, Glencoe. 
Nothing is sturdy, nothing is majestic, 
There is no quiet drama, no rubbed glaze, no 
Unkillable infirmity of such 
A tasteful turn as lately they have left, 
Glencoe, Lake Forest, and to which their cars 
Must presently restore them. When they're done 
With dullards and distortions of this fistic 
Patience of the poor and put-upon. 
They've never seen such a make-do-ness as 
Newspaper rugs before! In this, this 'flat,' 
Their hostess is gathering up the oozed, the rich 
Rugs of the morning (tattered! the bespattered. . . .) 
Readies to spread clean rugs for afternoon. 
Here is a scene for you. The Ladies look, 
In horror, behind a substantial citizeness 
Whose trains clank out across her swollen heart. 
Who, arms akimbo, almost fills a door. 
All tumbling children, quilts dragged to the floor 
And tortured thereover, potato peelings, soft-
Eyed kitten, hunched-up, haggard, to-be-hurt. 
Their League is allotting largesse to the Lost. 
But to put their clean, their pretty money, to put 
Their money collected from delicate rose-fingers 
Tipped with their hundred flawless rose-nails seems... 
They own Spode, Lowestoft, candelabra, 
Mantels, and hostess gowns, and sunburst clocks, 
Turtle soup, Chippendale, red satin 'hangings,' 
Aubussons and Hattie Carnegie. They Winter 
In Palm Beach; cross the Water in June; attend, 
When suitable, the nice Art Institute; 
Buy the right books in the best bindings; saunter 
On Michigan, Easter mornings, in sun or wind. 
Oh Squalor! This sick four-story hulk, this fibre 
With fissures everywhere! Why, what are bringings 
Of loathe-love largesse? What shall peril hungers 
So old old, what shall flatter the desolate? 
Tin can, blocked fire escape and chitterling 
And swaggering seeking youth and the puzzled wreckage 
Of the middle passage, and urine and stale shames 
And, again, the porridges of the underslung 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>


And children children children. Heavens! That 
Was a rat, surely, off there, in the shadows? Long 
And long-tailed? Gray? The Ladies from the Ladies' 
Betterment League agree it will be better 
To achieve the outer air that rights and steadies, 
To hie to a house that does not holler, to ring 
Bells elsetime, better presently to cater 
To no more Possibilities, to get 
Away. Perhaps the money can be posted. 
Perhaps they two may choose another Slum! 
Some serious sooty half-unhappy home!-Where 
loathe-love likelier may be invested. 
Keeping their scented bodies in the center 
Of the hall as they walk down the hysterical hall, 
They allow their lovely skirts to graze no wall, 
Are off at what they manage of a canter, 
And, resuming all the clues of what they were, 
Try to avoid inhaling the laden air. 




The Mother 

Abortions will not let you forget. 
You remember the children you got that you did not get, 
The damp small pulps with a little or with no hair, 
The singers and workers that never handled the air. 
You will never neglect or beat 
Them, or silence or buy with a sweet. 
You will never wind up the sucking-thumb 
Or scuttle off ghosts that come. 
You will never leave them, controlling your luscious sigh, 
Return for a snack of them, with gobbling mother-eye. 

I have heard in the voices of the wind the voices of my dim killed 
children. 
I have contracted. I have eased 
My dim dears at the breasts they could never suck. 
I have said, Sweets, if I sinned, if I seized 
Your luck 
And your lives from your unfinished reach, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
If I stole your births and your names, 
Your straight baby tears and your games, 
Your stilted or lovely loves, your tumults, your marriages, aches, 
and your deaths, 
If I poisoned the beginnings of your breaths, 
Believe that even in my deliberateness I was not deliberate. 
Though why should I whine, 
Whine that the crime was other than mine?-Since 
anyhow you are dead. 
Or rather, or instead, 
You were never made. 
But that too, I am afraid, 
Is faulty: oh, what shall I say, how is the truth to be said? 
You were born, you had body, you died. 
It is just that you never giggled or planned or cried. 

Believe me, I loved you all. 
Believe me, I knew you, though faintly, and I loved, I loved you 
All. 






The Rites For Cousin Vit 

<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Carried her unprotesting out the door. 
Kicked back the casket-stand. But it can't hold her, 
That stuff and satin aiming to enfold her, 
The lid's contrition nor the bolts before. 
Oh oh. Too much. Too much. Even now, surmise, 
She rises in the sunshine. There she goes, 
Back to the bars she knew and the repose 
In love-rooms and the things in people's eyes. 
Too vital and too squeaking. Must emerge. 
Even now she does the snake-hips with a hiss, 
Slops the bad wine across her shantung, talks 
Of pregnancy, guitars and bridgework, walks 
In parks or alleys, comes haply on the verge 
Of happiness, haply hysterics. Is. 




The Sermon On The Warpland 

“The fact that we are black 
is our ultimate reality.” 
—Ron Karenga 

And several strengths from drowsiness campaigned 
but spoke in Single Sermon on the warpland. 

And went about the warpland saying No. 
“My people, black and black, revile the River. 
Say that the River turns, and turn the River. 

Say that our Something in doublepod contains 
sees for the coming hell and health together. 
Prepare to meet 
(sisters, brothers) the brash and terrible weather; 
the pains; 
the bruising; the collapse of bestials, idols. 
But then oh then!—the stuffing of the hulls! 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
the seasoning of the perilousl sweet! 
the health! The heralding of the clear obscure! 

Build now your Church, my brothers, sisters. Build 
never with brick or Corten nor with granite. 
Build with lithe love. With love like lion-eyes. 
with love like morningrise. 
with love like black, our black— 
luminously indiscreet; 
complete; continuous.” 




The Sonnet-Ballad 

Oh mother, mother, where is happiness? 
They took my lover's tallness off to war, 
Left me lamenting. Now I cannot guess 
What I can use an empty heart-cup for. 
He won't be coming back here any more. 
Some day the war will end, but, oh, I knew 
When he went walking grandly out that door 
That my sweet love would have to be untrue. 
Would have to be untrue. Would have to court 
Coquettish death, whose impudent and strange 
Possessive arms and beauty (of a sort) 
Can make a hard man hesitate--and change. 
And he will be the one to stammer, "Yes." 
Oh mother, mother, where is happiness? 




The Sundays Of Satin-Legs Smith 

Inamoratas, with an approbation, 
Bestowed his title. Blessed his inclination. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

He wakes, unwinds, elaborately: a cat 
Tawny, reluctant, royal. He is fat 
And fine this morning. Definite. Reimbursed. 

He waits a moment, he designs his reign, 
That no performance may be plain or vain. 
Then rises in a clear delirium. 

He sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days. 
And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the 
Postponed resentments and the prim precautions. 

Now, at his bath, would you deny him lavender 
Or take away the power of his pine? 
What smelly substitute, heady as wine, 
Would you provide? life must be aromatic. 
There must be scent, somehow there must be some. 
Would you have flowers in his life? suggest 
Asters? a Really Good geranium? 
A white carnation? would you prescribe a Show 
With the cold lilies, formal chrysanthemum 
Magnificence, poinsettias, and emphatic 
Red of prize roses? might his happiest 
Alternative (you muse) be, after all, 
A bit of gentle garden in the best 
Of taste and straight tradition? Maybe so. 
But you forget, or did you ever know, 
His heritage of cabbage and pigtails, 
Old intimacy with alleys, garbage pails, 
Down in the deep (but always beautiful) South 
Where roses blush their blithest (it is said) 
And sweet magnolias put Chanel to shame. 

No! He has not a flower to his name. 
Except a feather one, for his lapel. 
Apart from that, if he should think of flowers 


<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

It is in terms of dandelions or death. 
Ah, there is little hope. You might as well— 
Unless you care to set the world a-boil 
And do a lot of equalizing things, 
Remove a little ermine, say, from kings, 
Shake hands with paupers and appoint them men, 
For instance—certainly you might as well 
Leave him his lotion, lavender and oil. 

Let us proceed. Let us inspect, together 
With his meticulous and serious love, 
The innards of this closet. Which is a vault 
Whose glory is not diamonds, not pearls, 
Not silver plate with just enough dull shine. 
But wonder-suits in yellow and in wine, 
Sarcastic green and zebra-striped cobalt. 
With shoulder padding that is wide 
And cocky and determined as his pride; 
Ballooning pants that taper off to ends 
Scheduled to choke precisely.

 Here are hats 
Like bright umbrellas; and hysterical ties 
Like narrow banners for some gathering war. 

People are so in need, in need of help. 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
People want so much that they do not know. 

Below the tinkling trade of little coins 
The gold impulse not possible to show 
Or spend. Promise piled over and betrayed. 

These kneaded limbs receive the kiss of silk. 
Then they receive the brave and beautiful 
Embrace of some of that equivocal wool. 
He looks into his mirror, loves himself— 
The neat curve here; the angularity 
That is appropriate at just its place; 
The technique of a variegated grace. 

Here is all his sculpture and his art 
And all his architectural design. 
Perhaps you would prefer to this a fine 



Value of marble, complicated stone. 
Would have him think with horror of baroque, 
Rococo. You forget and you forget. 

He dances down the hotel steps that keep 
Remnants of last night’s high life and distress. 
As spat-out purchased kisses and spilled beer. 
He swallows sunshine with a secret yelp. 
Passes to coffee and a roll or two. 
Has breakfasted.

 Out. Sounds about him smear, 
Become a unit. He hears and does not hear 
The alarm clock meddling in somebody’s sleep; 
Children’s governed Sunday happiness; 
The dry tone of a plane; a woman’s oath; 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Consumption’s spiritless expectoration; 
An indignant robin’s resolute donation 
Pinching a track through apathy and din; 
Restaurant vendors weeping; and the L 
That comes on like a slightly horrible thought. 

Pictures, too, as usual, are blurred. 
He sees and does not see the broken windows 
Hiding their shame with newsprint; little girl 
With ribbons decking wornness, little boy 
Wearing the trousers with the decentest patch, 
To honor Sunday; women on their way 
From “service,” temperate holiness arranged 
Ably on asking faces; men estranged 
From music and from wonder and from joy 
But far familiar with the guiding awe 
Of foodlessness.

 He loiters.

 Restaurant vendors 
Weep, or out of them rolls a restless glee. 
The Lonesome Blues, the Long-lost Blues, I Want A 
Big Fat Mama. Down these sore avenues 
Comes no Saint-Saëns, no piquant elusive Grieg, 
And not Tschaikovsky’s wayward eloquence 
And not the shapely tender drift of Brahms. 
But could he love them? Since a man must bring 
To music what his mother spanked him for 



When he was two: bits of forgotten hate, 
Devotion: whether or not his mattress hurts: 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The little dream his father humored: the thing 
His sister did for money: what he ate 
For breakfast—and for dinner twenty years 
Ago last autumn: all his skipped desserts. 

The pasts of his ancestors lean against 
Him. Crowd him. Fog out his identity. 
Hundreds of hungers mingle with his own, 
Hundreds of voices advise so dexterously 
He quite considers his reactions his, 
Judges he walks most powerfully alone, 
That everything is—simply what it is. 

But movie-time approaches, time to boo 
The hero’s kiss, and boo the heroine 
Whose ivory and yellow it is sin 
For his eye to eat of. The Mickey Mouse, 
However, is for everyone in the house. 

Squires his lady to dinner at Joe’s Eats. 
His lady alters as to leg and eye, 
Thickness and height, such minor points as these, 
From Sunday to Sunday. But no matter what 
Her name or body positively she’s 
In Queen Lace stockings with ambitious heels 

That strain to kiss the calves, and vivid shoes 
Frontless and backless, Chinese fingernails, 
Earrings, three layers of lipstick, intense hat 
Dripping with the most voluble of veils. 
Her affable extremes are like sweet bombs 
About him, whom no middle grace or good 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Could gratify. He had no education 
In quiet arts of compromise. He would 
Not understand your counsels on control, nor 
Thank you for your late trouble.

 At Joe’s Eats 
You get your fish or chicken on meat platters. 
With coleslaw, macaroni, candied sweets, 
Coffee and apple pie. You go out full. 



(The end is—isn’t it?—all that really matters.) 

And even and intrepid come 
The tender boots of night to home.

 Her body is like new brown bread 
Under the Woolworth mignonette. 
Her body is a honey bowl 
Whose waiting honey is deep and hot, 
Her body is like summer earth, 
Receptive, soft, and absolute ... 




The Vacant Lot 

Mrs. Coley’s three-flat brick 
Isn’t here any more. 
All done with seeing her fat little form 
Burst out of the basement door; 
And with seeing her African son-in-law 
(Rightful heir to the throne) 
With his great white strong cold squares of teeth 
And his little eyes of stone; 
And with seeing the squat fat daughter 
Letting in the men 
When majesty has gone for the day— 
And letting them out again.

To Be In Love 

To be in love 
Is to touch with a lighter hand. 
In yourself you stretch, you are well. 
You look at things 
Through his eyes. 
A cardinal is red. 
A sky is blue. 
Suddenly you know he knows too. 
He is not there but 
You know you are tasting together 
The winter, or a light spring weather. 
His hand to take your hand is overmuch. 
Too much to bear. 
You cannot look in his eyes 
Because your pulse must not say 
What must not be said. 
When he 
Shuts a door-
Is not there_ 
Your arms are water. 
And you are free 
With a ghastly freedom. 
You are the beautiful half 
Of a golden hurt. 
You remember and covet his mouth 
To touch, to whisper on. 
Oh when to declare 
Is certain Death! 
Oh when to apprize 
Is to mesmerize, 
To see fall down, the Column of Gold, 
Into the commonest ash.

To The Diaspora 

you did not know you were Afrika 

When you set out for Afrika 
you did not know you were going. 
Because 
you did not know you were Afrika. 
You did not know the Black continent 
that had to be reached 
was you. 

I could not have told you then that some sun 
would come, 
somewhere over the road, 
would come evoking the diamonds 
of you, the Black continent-somewhere 
over the road. 
You would not have believed my mouth. 

When I told you, meeting you somewhere close 
to the heat and youth of the road, 
liking my loyalty, liking belief, 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
you smiled and you thanked me but very little believed me. 

Here is some sun. Some. 
Now off into the places rough to reach. 
Though dry, though drowsy, all unwillingly a-wobble, 
into the dissonant and dangerous crescendo. 
Your work, that was done, to be done to be done to be done. 




Tommy 

I put my seed into the ground 
And said, 'I'll watch it grow.' 
I watered it and cared for it 
As well as I could know. 

One day I walked in my back yard, 
And oh. what did I see! 
My seed had popped itself right out 
Without consulting me. 




Truth 

And if sun comes 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
How shall we greet him? 
Shall we not dread him, 
Shall we not fear him 
After so lengthy a 
Session with shade? 

Though we have wept for him, 
Though we have prayed 
All through the night-years— 
What if we wake one shimmering morning to 
Hear the fierce hammering 
Of his firm knuckles 
Hard on the door? 

Shall we not shudder?— 
Shall we not flee 
Into the shelter, the dear thick shelter 
Of the familiar 
Propitious haze? 

Sweet is it, sweet is it 
To sleep in the coolness 
Of snug unawareness. 

The dark hangs heavily 
Over the eyes.

We Real Cool 

The Pool Players. 
Seven at the Golden Shovel. 

We real cool. We 
Left school. We 

Lurk late. We 
Strike straight. We 

Sing sin. We 
Thin gin. We 

Jazz June. We 
Die soon. 




When You Have Forgotten Sunday: The Love Story 

—And when you have forgotten the bright bedclothes on a Wednesday and a 
Saturday, 
And most especially when you have forgotten Sunday— 
When you have forgotten Sunday halves in bed, 
Or me sitting on the front-room radiator in the limping afternoon 
Looking off down the long street 
To nowhere, 
Hugged by my plain old wrapper of no-expectation 
And nothing-I-have-to-do and I’m-happy-why? 
And if-Monday-never-had-to-come— 
When you have forgotten that, I say, 
And how you swore, if somebody beeped the bell, 
And how my heart played hopscotch if the telephone rang; 
And how we finally went in to Sunday dinner, 
That is to say, went across the front room floor to the ink-spotted table in the 
southwest corner 
To Sunday dinner, which was always chicken and noodles 
Or chicken and rice 
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And salad and rye bread and tea 
And chocolate chip cookies— 
I say, when you have forgotten that, 
When you have forgotten my little presentiment 
That the war would be over before they got to you; 
And how we finally undressed and whipped out the light and flowed into bed, 
And lay loose-limbed for a moment in the week-end 
Bright bedclothes, 
Then gently folded into each other— 
When you have, I say, forgotten all that, 
Then you may tell, 
Then I may believe 
You have forgotten me well. 




Young Afrikans 

of the furious 

Who take Today and jerk it out of joint 
have made new underpinnings and a Head. 

Blacktime is time for chimeful 
poemhood 
but they decree a 
jagged chiming now. 

If there are flowers flowers 
must come out to the road. Rowdy!— 
knowing where wheels and people are, 
knowing where whips and screams are, 
knowing where deaths are, where the kind kills are. 

As for that other kind of kindness, 
if there is milk it must be mindful. 
The milkofhumankindness must be mindful 
as wily wines. 
Must be fine fury. 
Must be mega, must be main.

Taking Today (to jerk it out of joint) 
the hardheroic maim the 
leechlike-as-usual who use, 
adhere to, carp, and harm. 

And they await, 
across the Changes and the spiraling dead, 
our Black revival, our Black vinegar, 
our hands, and our hot blood.
