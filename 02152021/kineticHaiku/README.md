This is a haiku generator based off of SoundShapesBox2d, still has a lot of work to go,
especially on the sound side, but most of the components are in place. The word database is from
http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/words/partsofspeech.html , a very comprehensive and nicely organized
list of english words.
