A Dream 
In visions of the dark night 
I have dreamed of joy departedBut 
a waking dream of life and light 
Hath left me broken-hearted.
 Ah! what is not a dream by day 
To him whose eyes are cast 
On things around him with a ray 
Turned back upon the past?
 That holy dream- that holy dream, 
While all the world were chiding, 
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
 A lonely spirit guiding.
 What though that light, thro' storm and night, 
So trembled from afarWhat 
could there be more purely bright 
In Truth's day-star? 
A Dream Within A Dream 
Take this kiss upon the brow! 
And, in parting from you now, 
Thus much let me avowYou 
are not wrong, who deem 
That my days have been a dream; 
Yet if hope has flown away 
In a night, or in a day, 
In a vision, or in none, 
Is it therefore the less gone? 
All that we see or seem 
Is but a dream within a dream.
 I stand amid the roar 
Of a surf-tormented shore, 
And I hold within my hand 
Grains of the golden sandHow 
few! yet how they creep 
Through my fingers to the deep, 
While I weep- while I weep! 
O God! can I not grasp 
Them with a tighter clasp? 
O God! can I not save 
One from the pitiless wave? 
Is all that we see or seem 
But a dream within a dream? 
A Paean 
How shall the burial rite be read? 
The solemn song be sung? 
The requiem for the loveliest dead, 
That ever died so young? 
II. 
Her friends are gazing on her, 
And on her gaudy bier, 
And weep! - oh! to dishonor 
Dead beauty with a tear! 
III. 
They loved her for her wealth And 
they hated her for her pride But 
she grew in feeble health, 
And they love her - that she died. 
IV. 
They tell me (while they speak 
Of her 'costly broider'd pall') 
That my voice is growing weak That 
I should not sing at all 
V. 
Or that my tone should be 
Tun'd to such solemn song 
So mournfully - so mournfully, 
That the dead may feel no wrong. 
VI. 
But she is gone above, 
With young Hope at her side, 
And I am drunk with love 
Of the dead, who is my bride. 
VII. 
Of the dead - dead who lies 
All perfum'd there, 
With the death upon her eyes, 
And the life upon her hair. 
VIII. 
Thus on the coffin loud and long 
I strike - the murmur sent 
Through the grey chambers to my song, 
Shall be the accompaniment. 
IX. 
Thou died'st in thy life's June But 
thou did'st not die too fair: 
Thou did'st not die too soon, 
Nor with too calm an air. 
X. 
From more than fiends on earth, 
Thy life and love are riven, 
To join the untainted mirth 
Of more than thrones in heaven 
XII. 
Therefore, to thee this night 
I will no requiem raise, 
But waft thee on thy flight, 
With a PÃ¦an of old days. 
A Valentine 
For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes, 
Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,
 Shall find her own sweet name, that nestling lies 
Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader. 
Search narrowly the lines! - they hold a treasure
 Divine- a talisman- an amulet 
That must be worn at heart. Search well the measureThe 
words- the syllables! Do not forget 
The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor 
And yet there is in this no Gordian knot 
Which one might not undo without a sabre, 
If one could merely comprehend the plot. 
Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering 
Eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdus 
Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing 
Of poets, by poets- as the name is a poet's, too, 
Its letters, although naturally lying 
Like the knight Pinto- Mendez FerdinandoStill 
form a synonym for Truth- Cease trying! 
You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do. 
Al Aaraaf 
PART I
 O! nothing earthly save the ray 
(Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye, 
As in those gardens where the day 
Springs from the gems of CircassyO! 
nothing earthly save the thrill 
Of melody in woodland rillOr 
(music of the passion-hearted) 
Joy's voice so peacefully departed 
That like the murmur in the shell, 
Its echo dwelleth and will dwellOh, 
nothing of the dross of oursYet 
all the beauty- all the flowers 
That list our Love, and deck our bowersAdorn 
yon world afar, afarThe 
wandering star.
 'Twas a sweet time for Nesace- for there 
Her world lay lolling on the golden air, 
Near four bright suns- a temporary restAn 
oasis in desert of the blest. 
Away- away- 'mid seas of rays that roll 
Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soulThe 
soul that scarce (the billows are so dense) 
Can struggle to its destin'd eminence,To 
distant spheres, from time to time, she rode 
And late to ours, the favor'd one of GodBut, 
now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm, 
She throws aside the sceptre- leaves the helm, 
And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns, 
Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.
 Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth, 
Whence sprang the 'Idea of Beauty' into birth, 
(Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star, 
Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar, 
It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt) 
She looked into Infinity- and knelt. 
 Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curledFit 
emblems of the model of her worldSeen 
but in beauty- not impeding sight 
Of other beauty glittering thro' the lightA 
wreath that twined each starry form around, 
And all the opal'd air in color bound.
 All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed 
Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head 
On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang 
So eagerly around about to hang 
Upon the flying footsteps of- deep prideOf 
her who lov'd a mortal- and so died. 
The Sephalica, budding with young bees, 
Upreared its purple stem around her knees:And 
gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'dInmate 
of highest stars, where erst it sham'd 
All other loveliness:- its honied dew 
(The fabled nectar that the heathen knew) 
Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven, 
And fell on gardens of the unforgiven 
In Trebizond- and on a sunny flower 
So like its own above that, to this hour, 
It still remaineth, torturing the bee 
With madness, and unwonted reverie: 
In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf 
And blossom of the fairy plant in grief 
Disconsolate linger- grief that hangs her head, 
Repenting follies that full long have Red, 
Heaving her white breast to the balmy air, 
Like guilty beauty, chasten'd and more fair: 
Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light 
She fears to perfume, perfuming the night: 
And Clytia, pondering between many a sun, 
While pettish tears adown her petals run: 
And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth, 
And died, ere scarce exalted into birth, 
Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing 
Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king: 
And Valisnerian lotus, thither flown' 
From struggling with the waters of the Rhone: 
And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante! 
 Isola d'oro!- Fior di Levante! 
And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever 
With Indian Cupid down the holy riverFair 
flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given 
To bear the Goddess' song, in odors, up to Heaven:
 'Spirit! that dwellest where, 
In the deep sky, 
The terrible and fair, 
In beauty vie! 
Beyond the line of blueThe 
boundary of the star 
Which turneth at the view 
Of thy barrier and thy barOf 
the barrier overgone 
By the comets who were cast 
From their pride and from their throne 
To be drudges till the lastTo 
be carriers of fire 
(The red fire of their heart) 
With speed that may not tire 
And with pain that shall not partWho 
livest- that we knowIn 
Eternity- we feelBut 
the shadow of whose brow 
What spirit shall reveal? 
Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace, 
Thy messenger hath known 
Have dream'd for thy Infinity 
A model of their ownThy 
will is done, O God! 
The star hath ridden high 
Thro' many a tempest, but she rode
 Beneath thy burning eye; 
And here, in thought, to theeIn 
thought that can alone 
Ascend thy empire and so be
 A partner of thy throneBy 
winged Fantasy, 
My embassy is given, 
Till secrecy shall knowledge be
 In the environs of Heaven.' 
 She ceas'd- and buried then her burning cheek 
Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek 
A shelter from the fervor of His eye; 
For the stars trembled at the Deity. 
She stirr'd not- breath'd not- for a voice was there 
How solemnly pervading the calm air! 
A sound of silence on the startled ear 
Which dreamy poets name 'the music of the sphere.' 
Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call 
'Silence'- which is the merest word of all. 
All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things 
Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wingsBut 
ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high 
The eternal voice of God is passing by, 
And the red winds are withering in the sky:
'What tho 'in worlds which sightless cycles run, 
Linked to a little system, and one sunWhere 
all my love is folly and the crowd 
Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud, 
The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath(
Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?) 
What tho' in worlds which own a single sun 
The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run, 
Yet thine is my resplendency, so given 
To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven! 
Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly, 
With all thy train, athwart the moony skyApart- 
like fire-flies in Sicilian night, 
And wing to other worlds another light! 
Divulge the secrets of thy embassy 
To the proud orbs that twinkle- and so be 
To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban 
Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!'
 Up rose the maiden in the yellow night, 
The single-mooned eve!- on Earth we plight 
Our faith to one love- and one moon adoreThe 
birth-place of young Beauty had no more. 
As sprang that yellow star from downy hours 
Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers, 
 And bent o'er sheeny mountains and dim plain 
Her way, but left not yet her Therasaean reign. 
PART II
 High on a mountain of enamell'd headSuch 
as the drowsy shepherd on his bed 
Of giant pasturage lying at his ease, 
Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees 
With many a mutter'd 'hope to be forgiven' 
What time the moon is quadrated in HeavenOf 
rosy head that, towering far away 
Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray 
Of sunken suns at eve- at noon of night, 
While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger lightUprear'd 
upon such height arose a pile 
Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air, 
Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile 
Far down upon the wave that sparkled there, 
And nursled the young mountain in its lair. 
Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall 
Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall 
Of their own dissolution, while they dieAdorning 
then the dwellings of the sky. 
A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down, 
Sat gently on these columns as a crownA 
window of one circular diamond, there, 
Look'd out above into the purple air, 
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain 
And hallow'd all the beauty twice again, 
Save, when, between th' empyrean and that ring, 
Some eager spirit Flapp'd his dusky wing. 
But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen 
The dimness of this world: that greyish green 
That Nature loves the best Beauty's grave 
Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architraveAnd 
every sculptur'd cherub thereabout 
That from his marble dwelling peered out, 
Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his nicheAchaian 
statues in a world so rich! 
Friezes from Tadmor and PersepolisFrom 
Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss 
 Of beautiful Gomorrah! O, the wave 
Is now upon thee- but too late to save!
 Sound loves to revel in a summer night: 
Witness the murmur of the grey twilight 
That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco, 
Of many a wild star-gazer long agoThat 
stealeth ever on the ear of him 
Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim, 
And sees the darkness coming as a cloudIs 
not its form- its voice- most palpable and loud?
 But what is this?- it cometh, and it brings 
A music with it- 'tis the rush of wingsA 
pause- and then a sweeping, falling strain 
And Nesace is in her halls again. 
From the wild energy of wanton haste
 Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart; 
And zone that clung around her gentle waist
 Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart. 
Within the centre of that hall to breathe, 
She paused and panted, Zanthe! all beneath, 
The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair 
And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there.
 Young flowers were whispering in melody 
To happy flowers that night- and tree to tree; 
Fountains were gushing music as they fell 
In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell; 
Yet silence came upon material thingsFair 
flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wingsAnd 
sound alone that from the spirit sprang 
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:
 ''Neath the blue-bell or streamerOr 
tufted wild spray 
That keeps, from the dreamer, 
The moonbeam awayBright 
beings! that ponder, 
With half closing eyes, 
On the stars which your wonder 
Hath drawn from the skies, 
 Till they glance thro' the shade, and 
Come down to your brow 
Like- eyes of the maiden 
Who calls on you nowArise! 
from your dreaming 
In violet bowers, 
To duty beseeming 
These star-litten hoursAnd 
shake from your tresses 
Encumber'd with dew 
The breath of those kisses 
That cumber them too(
O! how, without you, Love! 
Could angels be blest?) 
Those kisses of true Love 
That lull'd ye to rest! 
Up!- shake from your wing 
Each hindering thing: 
The dew of the nightIt 
would weigh down your flight 
And true love caressesO, 
leave them apart! 
They are light on the tresses, 
But lead on the heart.
 Ligeia! Ligeia! 
My beautiful one! 
Whose harshest idea 
Will to melody run, 
O! is it thy will 
On the breezes to toss? 
Or, capriciously still, 
Like the lone Albatros, 
Incumbent on night 
(As she on the air) 
To keep watch with delight 
On the harmony there?
 Ligeia! wherever 
Thy image may be, 
No magic shall sever 
Thy music from thee. 
 Thou hast bound many eyes 
In a dreamy sleepBut 
the strains still arise 
Which thy vigilance keepThe 
sound of the rain, 
Which leaps down to the flowerAnd 
dances again 
In the rhythm of the showerThe 
murmur that springs 
From the growing of grass 
Are the music of thingsBut 
are modell'd, alas!Away, 
then, my dearest, 
Oh! hie thee away 
To the springs that lie clearest 
Beneath the moon-rayTo 
lone lake that smiles, 
In its dream of deep rest, 
At the many star-isles 
That enjewel its breastWhere 
wild flowers, creeping, 
Have mingled their shade, 
On its margin is sleeping 
Full many a maidSome 
have left the cool glade, and 
Have slept with the beeArouse 
them, my maiden, 
On moorland and leaGo! 
breathe on their slumber, 
All softly in ear, 
Thy musical number 
They slumbered to hearFor 
what can awaken 
An angel so soon, 
Whose sleep hath been taken 
Beneath the cold moon, 
As the spell which no slumber 
Of witchery may test, 
The rhythmical number 
Which lull'd him to rest?'
 Spirits in wing, and angels to the view, 
 A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro', 
Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flightSeraphs 
in all but 'Knowledge,' the keen light 
That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds, afar, 
O Death! from eye of God upon that star: 
Sweet was that error- sweeter still that deathSweet 
was that error- even with us the breath 
Of Science dims the mirror of our joyTo 
them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroyFor 
what (to them) availeth it to know 
That Truth is Falsehood- or that Bliss is Woe? 
Sweet was their death- with them to die was rife 
With the last ecstasy of satiate lifeBeyond 
that death no immortalityBut 
sleep that pondereth and is not 'to be'!And 
there- oh! may my weary spirit dwellApart 
from Heaven's Eternity- and yet how far from Hell! 
What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim, 
Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn? 
But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts 
To those who hear not for their beating hearts. 
A maiden-angel and her seraph-loverO! 
where (and ye may seek the wide skies over) 
Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known? 
Unguided Love hath fallen- 'mid 'tears of perfect moan.' 
He was a goodly spirit- he who fell: 
A wanderer by moss-y-mantled wellA 
gazer on the lights that shine aboveA 
dreamer in the moonbeam by his love: 
What wonder? for each star is eye-like there, 
And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hairAnd 
they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy 
To his love-haunted heart and melancholy. 
The night had found (to him a night of woe) 
Upon a mountain crag, young AngeloBeetling 
it bends athwart the solemn sky, 
And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie. 
Here sat he with his love- his dark eye bent 
With eagle gaze along the firmament: 
Now turn'd it upon her- but ever then 
It trembled to the orb of EARTH again. 
 'Ianthe, dearest, see- how dim that ray! 
How lovely 'tis to look so far away! 
She seem'd not thus upon that autumn eve 
I left her gorgeous halls- nor mourn'd to leave. 
That eve- that eve- I should remember wellThe 
sun-ray dropp'd in Lemnos, with a spell 
On th' arabesque carving of a gilded hall 
Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wallAnd 
on my eyelids- O the heavy light! 
How drowsily it weigh'd them into night! 
On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran 
With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan: 
But O that light!- I slumber'd- Death, the while, 
Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle 
So softly that no single silken hair 
Awoke that slept- or knew that he was there.
 'The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon 
Was a proud temple call'd the Parthenon; 
More beauty clung around her column'd wall 
Than ev'n thy glowing bosom beats withal, 
And when old Time my wing did disenthral 
Thence sprang I- as the eagle from his tower, 
And years I left behind me in an hour. 
What time upon her airy bounds I hung, 
One half the garden of her globe was flung 
Unrolling as a chart unto my viewTenantless 
cities of the desert too! 
Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then, 
And half I wish'd to be again of men.'
 'My Angelo! and why of them to be? 
A brighter dwelling-place is here for theeAnd 
greener fields than in yon world above, 
And woman's loveliness- and passionate love.'
 'But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft 
Fail'd, as my pennon'd spirit leapt aloft, 
Perhaps my brain grew dizzy- but the world 
I left so late was into chaos hurl'dSprang 
from her station, on the winds apart. 
And roll'd, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart. 
 Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar 
And fell- not swiftly as I rose before, 
But with a downward, tremulous motion thro' 
Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto! 
Nor long the measure of my falling hours, 
For nearest of all stars was thine to oursDread 
star! that came, amid a night of mirth, 
A red Daedalion on the timid Earth.'
 'We came- and to thy Earth- but not to us 
Be given our lady's bidding to discuss: 
We came, my love; around, above, below, 
Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go, 
Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod 
She grants to us, as granted by her GodBut, 
Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl'd 
Never his fairy wing O'er fairier world! 
Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes 
Alone could see the phantom in the skies, 
When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be 
Headlong thitherward o'er the starry seaBut 
when its glory swell'd upon the sky, 
As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye, 
We paused before the heritage of men, 
And thy star trembled- as doth Beauty then!'
 Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away 
The night that waned and waned and brought no day. 
They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts 
Who hear not for the beating of their hearts. 
Alone 
From childhood's hour I have not been 
As others were; I have not seen 
As others saw; I could not bring 
My passions from a common spring. 
From the same source I have not taken 
My sorrow; I could not awaken 
My heart to joy at the same tone; 
And all I loved, I loved alone. 
Then- in my childhood, in the dawn 
Of a most stormy life- was drawn 
From every depth of good and ill 
The mystery which binds me still: 
From the torrent, or the fountain, 
From the red cliff of the mountain, 
From the sun that round me rolled 
In its autumn tint of gold, 
From the lightning in the sky 
As it passed me flying by, 
From the thunder and the storm, 
And the cloud that took the form 
(When the rest of Heaven was blue) 
Of a demon in my view. 
An Acrostic 
Elizabeth it is in vain you say 
'Love not' â thou sayest it in so sweet a way: 
In vain those words from thee or L. E. L. 
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well: 
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise, 
Breathe it less gently forth â and veil thine eyes. 
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried 
To cure his love â was cured of all beside â 
His folly â pride â and passion â for he died. 
An Enigma 
"Seldom we find," says Solomon Don Dunce, 
"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
 Through all the flimsy things we see at once 
As easily as through a Naples bonnetTrash 
of all trash!- how can a lady don it?
 Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuffOwl-
downy nonsense that the faintest puff
 Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it." 
And, veritably, Sol is right enough. 
The general tuckermanities are arrant 
Bubbles- ephemeral and so transparent
But this is, now- you may depend upon itStable, 
opaque, immortal- all by dint 
Of the dear names that he concealed within 't. 
Annabel Lee 
It was many and many a year ago, 
In a kingdom by the sea, 
That a maiden there lived whom you may know 
By the name of ANNABEL LEE; 
And this maiden she lived with no other thought 
Than to love and be loved by me.
 I was a child and she was a child, 
In this kingdom by the sea; 
But we loved with a love that was more than loveI 
and my Annabel Lee; 
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven 
Coveted her and me.
 And this was the reason that, long ago, 
In this kingdom by the sea, 
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling 
My beautiful Annabel Lee; 
So that her highborn kinsman came 
And bore her away from me, 
To shut her up in a sepulchre 
In this kingdom by the sea.
 The angels, not half so happy in heaven, 
Went envying her and meYes! 
- that was the reason (as all men know, 
In this kingdom by the sea) 
That the wind came out of the cloud by night, 
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
 But our love it was stronger by far than the love 
Of those who were older than weOf 
many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in heaven above, 
Nor the demons down under the sea, 
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul 
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
 For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams 
 Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
 Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side 
Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,
 In the sepulchre there by the sea, 
In her tomb by the sounding sea. 
Bridal Ballad 
The ring is on my hand, 
And the wreath is on my brow; 
Satin and jewels grand 
Are all at my command, 
And I am happy now.
 And my lord he loves me well;
 But, when first he breathed his vow, 
I felt my bosom swellFor 
the words rang as a knell, 
And the voice seemed his who fell 
In the battle down the dell,
 And who is happy now.
 But he spoke to re-assure me,
 And he kissed my pallid brow, 
While a reverie came o'er me, 
And to the church-yard bore me, 
And I sighed to him before me, 
Thinking him dead D'Elormie, 
"Oh, I am happy now!"
 And thus the words were spoken,
 And this the plighted vow, 
And, though my faith be broken, 
And, though my heart be broken, 
Here is a ring, as token
 That I am happy now!
 Would God I could awaken!
 For I dream I know not how! 
And my soul is sorely shaken 
Lest an evil step be taken,Lest 
the dead who is forsaken
 May not be happy now. 
Dreamland 
By a route obscure and lonely, 
Haunted by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, 
On a black throne reigns upright, 
I have reached these lands but newly 
From an ultimate dim ThuleFrom 
a wild clime that lieth, sublime,
 Out of SPACE- out of TIME.
 Bottomless vales and boundless floods, 
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods, 
With forms that no man can discover 
For the tears that drip all over; 
Mountains toppling evermore 
Into seas without a shore; 
Seas that restlessly aspire, 
Surging, unto skies of fire; 
Lakes that endlessly outspread 
Their lone waters- lone and dead,Their 
still waters- still and chilly 
With the snows of the lolling lily.
 By the lakes that thus outspread 
Their lone waters, lone and dead,Their 
sad waters, sad and chilly 
With the snows of the lolling lily,By 
the mountains- near the river 
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,By 
the grey woods,- by the swamp 
Where the toad and the newt encampBy 
the dismal tarns and pools
 Where dwell the Ghouls,By 
each spot the most unholyIn 
each nook most melancholyThere 
the traveller meets aghast 
Sheeted Memories of the PastShrouded 
forms that start and sigh 
As they pass the wanderer byWhite-
robed forms of friends long given, 
 In agony, to the Earth- and Heaven.
 For the heart whose woes are legion 
'Tis a peaceful, soothing regionFor 
the spirit that walks in shadow 
'Tis- oh, 'tis an Eldorado! 
But the traveller, travelling through it, 
May not- dare not openly view it! 
Never its mysteries are exposed 
To the weak human eye unclosed; 
So wills its King, who hath forbid 
The uplifting of the fringed lid; 
And thus the sad Soul that here passes 
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.
 By a route obscure and lonely, 
Haunted by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, 
On a black throne reigns upright, 
I have wandered home but newly 
From this ultimate dim Thule. 
Dreams 
Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!
 My spirit not awakening, till the beam
 Of an Eternity should bring the morrow.
 Yes! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
 'Twere better than the cold reality
 Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,
 And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,
 A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.
 But should it be- that dream eternally
 Continuing- as dreams have been to me
 In my young boyhood- should it thus be given,
 'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.
 For I have revell'd, when the sun was bright
 I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light
 And loveliness,- have left my very heart
 In climes of my imagining, apart
 From mine own home, with beings that have been
 Of mine own thought- what more could I have seen?
 'Twas once- and only once- and the wild hour
 From my remembrance shall not pass- some power
 Or spell had bound me- 'twas the chilly wind
 Came o'er me in the night, and left behind
 Its image on my spirit- or the moon
 Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
 Too coldly- or the stars- howe'er it was
 That dream was as that night-wind- let it pass.
 I have been happy, tho' in a dream. 
I have been happy- and I love the theme: 
Dreams! in their vivid coloring of life, 
As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife 
Of semblance with reality, which brings 
To the delirious eye, more lovely things 
Of Paradise and Love- and all our own! 
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known. 
Eldorado 
Gaily bedight, 
A gallant knight, 
In sunshine and in shadow, 
Had journeyed long, 
Singing a song, 
In search of Eldorado.
 But he grew old
This knight so bold
And o'er his heart a shadow 
Fell as he found 
No spot of ground
 That looked like Eldorado.
 And, as his strength
 Failed him at length,
 He met a pilgrim shadow"
Shadow," said he, 
"Where can it be
This land of Eldorado?"
 "Over the Mountains
 Of the Moon,
 Down the Valley of the Shadow, 
Ride, boldly ride," 
The shade replied
"If you seek for Eldorado!" 
Elizabeth 
Elizabeth, it surely is most fit 
[Logic and common usage so commanding] 
In thy own book that first thy name be writ, 
Zeno and other sages notwithstanding; 
And I have other reasons for so doing 
Besides my innate love of contradiction; 
Each poet - if a poet - in pursuing 
The muses thro' their bowers of Truth or Fiction, 
Has studied very little of his part, 
Read nothing, written less - in short's a fool 
Endued with neither soul, nor sense, nor art, 
Being ignorant of one important rule, 
Employed in even the theses of the schoolCalled 
- I forget the heathenish Greek name 
[Called anything, its meaning is the same] 
"Always write first things uppermost in the heart." 
Enigma 
The noblest name in Allegory's page, 
The hand that traced inexorable rage; 
A pleasing moralist whose page refined, 
Displays the deepest knowledge of the mind; 
A tender poet of a foreign tongue, 
(Indited in the language that he sung.) 
A bard of brilliant but unlicensed page 
At once the shame and glory of our age, 
The prince of harmony and stirling sense, 
The ancient dramatist of eminence, 
The bard that paints imagination's powers, 
And him whose song revives departed hours, 
Once more an ancient tragic bard recall, 
In boldness of design surpassing all. 
These names when rightly read, a name [make] known 
Which gathers all their glories in its own. 
Epigram For Wall Street 
I'll tell you a plan for gaining wealth, 
Better than banking, trade or leases â 
Take a bank note and fold it up, 
And then you will find your money in creases! 
This wonderful plan, without danger or loss, 
Keeps your cash in your hands, where nothing can trouble it; 
And every time that you fold it across, 
'Tis as plain as the light of the day that you double it! 
Eulalie 
I dwelt alone 
In a world of moan,
 And my soul was a stagnant tide, 
Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing brideTill 
the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.
 Ah, less- less bright 
The stars of the night 
Than the eyes of the radiant girl! 
That the vapor can make
 With the moon-tints of purple and pearl, 
Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curlCan 
compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie's most humble and careless
 curl.
 Now Doubt- now Pain 
Come never again,
 For her soul gives me sigh for sigh, 
And all day long 
Shines, bright and strong,
 Astarte within the sky, 
While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eyeWhile 
ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye. 
Evening Star 
'Twas noontide of summer, 
And mid-time of night; 
And stars, in their orbits, 
Shone pale, thro' the light 
Of the brighter, cold moon, 
'Mid planets her slaves, 
Herself in the Heavens,
 Her beam on the waves. 
I gazed awhile 
On her cold smile;
 Too cold- too cold for meThere 
pass'd, as a shroud, 
A fleecy cloud,
 And I turned away to thee, 
Proud Evening Star, 
In thy glory afar,
 And dearer thy beam shall be; 
For joy to my heart 
Is the proud part
 Thou bearest in Heaven at night, 
And more I admire 
Thy distant fire,
 Than that colder, lowly light. 
Fairy-Land 
Dim vales- and shadowy floodsAnd 
cloudy-looking woods, 
Whose forms we can't discover 
For the tears that drip all over! 
Huge moons there wax and waneAgain- 
again- againEvery 
moment of the nightForever 
changing placesAnd 
they put out the star-light 
With the breath from their pale faces. 
About twelve by the moon-dial, 
One more filmy than the rest 
(A kind which, upon trial, 
They have found to be the best) 
Comes down- still down- and down, 
With its centre on the crown 
Of a mountain's eminence, 
While its wide circumference 
In easy drapery falls 
Over hamlets, over halls, 
Wherever they may beO'er 
the strange woods- o'er the seaOver 
spirits on the wingOver 
every drowsy thingAnd 
buries them up quite 
In a labyrinth of lightAnd 
then, how deep!- O, deep! 
Is the passion of their sleep. 
In the morning they arise, 
And their moony covering 
Is soaring in the skies, 
With the tempests as they toss, 
Like- almost anythingOr 
a yellow Albatross. 
They use that moon no more 
For the same end as beforeVidelicet, 
a tentWhich 
I think extravagant: 
Its atomies, however, 
 Into a shower dissever, 
Of which those butterflies 
Of Earth, who seek the skies, 
And so come down again, 
(Never-contented things!) 
Have brought a specimen 
Upon their quivering wings. 
For Annie 
Thank Heaven! the crisisThe 
danger is past, 
And the lingering illness 
Is over at lastAnd 
the fever called "Living" 
Is conquered at last.
 Sadly, I know 
I am shorn of my strength, 
And no muscle I move 
As I lie at full lengthBut 
no matter!-I feel 
I am better at length.
 And I rest so composedly, 
Now, in my bed 
That any beholder 
Might fancy me deadMight 
start at beholding me, 
Thinking me dead.
 The moaning and groaning, 
The sighing and sobbing, 
Are quieted now, 
With that horrible throbbing 
At heart:- ah, that horrible, 
Horrible throbbing!
 The sickness- the nauseaThe 
pitiless painHave 
ceased, with the fever 
That maddened my brainWith 
the fever called "Living" 
That burned in my brain.
 And oh! of all tortures 
That torture the worst 
Has abated- the terrible 
Torture of thirst 
 For the naphthaline river 
Of Passion accurst:I 
have drunk of a water 
That quenches all thirst:
Of a water that flows, 
With a lullaby sound, 
From a spring but a very few 
Feet under groundFrom 
a cavern not very far 
Down under ground.
 And ah! let it never 
Be foolishly said 
That my room it is gloomy 
And narrow my bed; 
For man never slept 
In a different bedAnd, 
to sleep, you must slumber 
In just such a bed.
 My tantalized spirit 
Here blandly reposes, 
Forgetting, or never 
Regretting its rosesIts 
old agitations 
Of myrtles and roses:
 For now, while so quietly 
Lying, it fancies 
A holier odor 
About it, of pansiesA 
rosemary odor, 
Commingled with pansiesWith 
rue and the beautiful 
Puritan pansies.
 And so it lies happily, 
Bathing in many 
A dream of the truth 
And the beauty of AnnieDrowned 
in a bath 
 Of the tresses of Annie.
 She tenderly kissed me, 
She fondly caressed, 
And then I fell gently 
To sleep on her breastDeeply 
to sleep 
From the heaven of her breast.
 When the light was extinguished, 
She covered me warm, 
And she prayed to the angels
 To keep me from harmTo 
the queen of the angels 
To shield me from harm.
 And I lie so composedly, 
Now, in my bed, 
(Knowing her love) 
That you fancy me deadAnd 
I rest so contentedly, 
Now, in my bed, 
(With her love at my breast) 
That you fancy me deadThat 
you shudder to look at me, 
Thinking me dead.
 But my heart it is brighter 
Than all of the many 
Stars in the sky, 
For it sparkles with AnnieIt 
glows with the light
 Of the love of my AnnieWith 
the thought of the light 
Of the eyes of my Annie. 
Hymn 
At morn- at noon- at twilight dimMaria! 
thou hast heard my hymn! 
In joy and woe- in good and illMother 
of God, be with me still! 
When the hours flew brightly by, 
And not a cloud obscured the sky, 
My soul, lest it should truant be, 
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee; 
Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast 
Darkly my Present and my Past, 
Let my Future radiant shine 
With sweet hopes of thee and thine! 
Hymn To Aristogeiton And Harmodius 
Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal 
Like those champions devoted and brave, 
When they plunged in the tyrant their steel, 
And to Athens deliverance gave. 
Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam 
In the joy breathing isles of the blest; 
Where the mighty of old have their home Where 
Achilles and Diomed rest. 
In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine, 
Like Harmodious, the gallant and good, 
When he made at the tutelar shrine 
A libation of Tyranny's blood. 
Ye deliverers of Athens from shame! 
Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs! 
Endless ages shall cherish your fame 
Embalmed in their echoing songs! 
Imitation 
A dark unfathomed tide 
Of interminable pride A 
mystery, and a dream, 
Should my early life seem; 
I say that dream was fraught 
With a wild and waking thought 
Of beings that have been, 
Which my spirit hath not seen, 
Had I let them pass me by, 
With a dreaming eye! 
Let none of earth inherit 
That vision of my spirit; 
Those thoughts I would control, 
As a spell upon his soul: 
For that bright hope at last 
And that light time have past, 
And my worldly rest hath gone 
With a sigh as it passed on: 
I care not though it perish 
With a thought I then did cherish 
Impromptu - To Kate Carol 
When from your gems of thought I turn 
To those pure orbs, your heart to learn, 
I scarce know which to prize most high â 
The bright i-dea, or the bright dear-eye. 
In The Greenest Of Our Valleys 
I. 
In the greenest of our valleys, 
By good angels tenanted, 
Once fair and stately palace -Radiant 
palace --reared its head. 
In the monarch Thought's dominion -It 
stood there! 
Never seraph spread a pinion 
Over fabric half so fair.
 II.
 Banners yellow, glorious, golden, 
On its roof did float and flow; 
(This --all this --was in the olden
 Time long ago) 
And every gentle air that dallied, 
In that sweet day, 
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, 
A winged odour went away.
 III. 
Wanderers in that happy valley 
Through two luminous windows saw 
Spirits moving musically 
To a lute's well-tuned law, 
Round about a throne, where sitting 
(Porphyrogene!) 
In state his glory well befitting, 
The ruler of the realm was seen.
 IV. 
And all with pearl and ruby glowing 
Was the fair palace door, 
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing 
And sparkling evermore, 
A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty 
Was but to sing, 
In voices of surpassing beauty, 
The wit and wisdom of their king. 
 V. 
But evil things, in robes of sorrow, 
Assailed the monarch's high estate; 
(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow 
Shall dawn upon him, desolate!) 
And, round about his home, the glory 
That blushed and bloomed 
Is but a dim-remembered story 
Of the old time entombed.
 VI. 
And travellers now within that valley, 
Through the red-litten windows, see 
Vast forms that move fantastically 
To a discordant melody; 
While, like a rapid ghastly river, 
Through the pale door, 
A hideous throng rush out forever, 
And laugh --but smile no more. 
In Youth I Have Known One 
How often we forget all time, when lone 
Admiring Nature's universal throne; 
Her woods - her winds - her mountains - the intense 
Reply of Hers to Our intelligence! 
I. 
In youth I have known one with whom the Earth 
In secret communing held - as he with it, 
In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth: 
Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit 
From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth 
A passionate light - such for his spirit was fit And 
yet that spirit knew - not in the hour 
Of its own fervour - what had o'er it power.
 II. 
Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought 
To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o'er, 
But I will half believe that wild light fraught 
With more of sovereignty than ancient lore 
Hath ever told - or is it of a thought 
The unembodied essence, and no more 
That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass 
As dew of the night time, o'er the summer grass?
 III. 
Doth o'er us pass, when as th' expanding eye 
To the loved object - so the tear to the lid 
Will start, which lately slept in apathy? 
And yet it need not be - (that object) hid 
From us in life - but common - which doth lie 
Each hour before us - but then only bid 
With a strange sound, as of a harpstring broken 
T' awake us - 'Tis a symbol and a token 
IV. 
Of what in other worlds shall be - and given 
In beauty by our God, to those alone 
Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven 
Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone, 
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven 
Though not with Faith - with godliness - whose throne 
With desperate energy 't hath beaten down; 
Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown. 
Israfel 
In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
 "Whose heart-strings are a lute"; 
None sing so wildly well 
As the angel Israfel, 
And the giddy stars (so legends tell), 
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
 Of his voice, all mute.
 Tottering above 
In her highest noon, 
The enamored moon
 Blushes with love, 
While, to listen, the red levin 
(With the rapid Pleiads, even, 
Which were seven,) 
Pauses in Heaven.
 And they say (the starry choir
 And the other listening things) 
That Israfeli's fire 
Is owing to that lyre
 By which he sits and singsThe 
trembling living wire 
Of those unusual strings.
 But the skies that angel trod, 
Where deep thoughts are a dutyWhere 
Love's a grown-up GodWhere 
the Houri glances are 
Imbued with all the beauty 
Which we worship in a star.
 Therefore thou art not wrong,
 Israfeli, who despisest 
An unimpassioned song; 
To thee the laurels belong,
 Best bard, because the wisest! 
Merrily live, and long! 
 The ecstasies above 
With thy burning measures suit
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love, 
With the fervor of thy luteWell 
may the stars be mute!
 Yes, Heaven is thine; but this 
Is a world of sweets and sours; 
Our flowers are merely- flowers,
 And the shadow of thy perfect bliss 
Is the sunshine of ours.
 If I could dwell 
Where Israfel 
Hath dwelt, and he where I, 
He might not sing so wildly well
 A mortal melody, 
While a bolder note than this might swell 
From my lyre within the sky. 
Lenore 
Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever! 
Let the bell toll!- a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river; 
And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?- weep now or nevermore! 
See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore! 
Come! let the burial rite be read- the funeral song be sung!An 
anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so youngA 
dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.
 "Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride, 
And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her- that she died! 
How shall the ritual, then, be read?- the requiem how be sung 
By you- by yours, the evil eye,- by yours, the slanderous tongue 
That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?"
 Peccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song 
Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong. 
The sweet Lenore hath "gone before," with Hope, that flew beside, 
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy
 bride. 
For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies, 
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes 
The life still there, upon her hair- the death upon her eyes.
 "Avaunt! avaunt! from fiends below, the indignant ghost is rivenFrom 
Hell unto a high estate far up within the HeavenFrom 
grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of
 Heaven! 
Let no bell toll, then,- lest her soul, amid its hallowed mirth, 
Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damned Earth! 
And I!- to-night my heart is light!- no dirge will I upraise, 
But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days!" 
Romance 
Romance, who loves to nod and sing, 
With drowsy head and folded wing, 
Among the green leaves as they shake 
Far down within some shadowy lake, 
To me a painted paroquet 
Hath been- a most familiar birdTaught 
me my alphabet to sayTo 
lisp my very earliest word 
While in the wild wood I did lie, 
A child- with a most knowing eye.
 Of late, eternal Condor years 
So shake the very Heaven on high 
With tumult as they thunder by, 
I have no time for idle cares 
Through gazing on the unquiet sky. 
And when an hour with calmer wings 
Its down upon my spirit flingsThat 
little time with lyre and rhyme 
To while away- forbidden things! 
My heart would feel to be a crime 
Unless it trembled with the strings. 
Sancta Maria 
Sancta Maria! turn thine eyes Upon 
the sinner's sacrifice, 
Of fervent prayer and humble love, 
From thy holy throne above. 
At morn - at noon - at twilight dim Maria! 
thou hast heard my hymn! 
In joy and wo - in good and ill Mother 
of God, be with me still! 
When the Hours flew brightly by, 
And not a cloud obscured the sky, 
My soul, lest it should truant be, 
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee; 
Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast 
Darkly my Present and my Past, 
Let my Future radiant shine 
With sweet hopes of thee and thine! 
Serenade 
So sweet the hour, so calm the time, 
I feel it more than half a crime, 
When Nature sleeps and stars are mute, 
To mar the silence ev'n with lute. 
At rest on ocean's brilliant dyes 
An image of Elysium lies: 
Seven Pleiades entranced in Heaven, 
Form in the deep another seven: 
Endymion nodding from above 
Sees in the sea a second love. 
Within the valleys dim and brown, 
And on the spectral mountain's crown, 
The wearied light is dying down, 
And earth, and stars, and sea, and sky 
Are redolent of sleep, as I 
Am redolent of thee and thine 
Enthralling love, my Adeline. 
But list, O list,- so soft and low 
Thy lover's voice tonight shall flow, 
That, scarce awake, thy soul shall deem 
My words the music of a dream. 
Thus, while no single sound too rude 
Upon thy slumber shall intrude, 
Our thoughts, our souls- O God above! 
In every deed shall mingle, love. 
Song 
I saw thee on thy bridal dayWhen 
a burning blush came o'er thee, 
Though happiness around thee lay, 
The world all love before thee:
 And in thine eye a kindling light 
(Whatever it might be) 
Was all on Earth my aching sight 
Of Loveliness could see.
 That blush, perhaps, was maiden shameAs 
such it well may passThough 
its glow hath raised a fiercer flame 
In the breast of him, alas!
 Who saw thee on that bridal day, 
When that deep blush would come o'er thee, 
Though happiness around thee lay; 
The world all love before thee. 
Sonnet- Silence 
There are some qualities- some incorporate things, 
That have a double life, which thus is made 
A type of that twin entity which springs 
From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
 There is a two-fold Silence- sea and shoreBody 
and soul. One dwells in lonely places, 
Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
 Some human memories and tearful lore, 
Render him terrorless: his name's "No More." 
He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
 No power hath he of evil in himself; 
But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
 Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf, 
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod 
No foot of man,) commend thyself to God! 
Sonnet- To Science 
Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art! 
Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes. 
Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart, 
Vulture, whose wings are dull realities? 
How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise, 
Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering 
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
 Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing? 
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car? 
And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
 To seek a shelter in some happier star?
 Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood, 
The Elfin from the green grass, and from me 
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree? 
Sonnet- To Zante 
Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers, 
Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take! 
How many memories of what radiant hours 
At sight of thee and thine at once awake! 
How many scenes of what departed bliss! 
How many thoughts of what entombed hopes! 
How many visions of a maiden that is 
No more- no more upon thy verdant slopes! 
No more! alas, that magical sad sound 
Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no moreThy 
memory no more! Accursed ground 
Henceforth I hold thy flower-enameled shore, 
O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante! 
"Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!" 
Spirits Of The Dead 
Thy soul shall find itself alone 
'Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone; 
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry 
Into thine hour of secrecy.
 Be silent in that solitude, 
Which is not loneliness- for then 
The spirits of the dead, who stood
 In life before thee, are again 
In death around thee, and their will 
Shall overshadow thee; be still.
 The night, though clear, shall frown, 
And the stars shall not look down 
From their high thrones in the Heaven 
With light like hope to mortals given, 
But their red orbs, without beam, 
To thy weariness shall seem 
As a burning and a fever 
Which would cling to thee for ever.
 Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish, 
Now are visions ne'er to vanish; 
From thy spirit shall they pass 
No more, like dew-drop from the grass.
 The breeze, the breath of God, is still, 
And the mist upon the hill 
Shadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken, 
Is a symbol and a token. 
How it hangs upon the trees, 
A mystery of mysteries! 
Stanzas

Tamerlane 
Kind solace in a dying hour! 
Such, father, is not (now) my theme
I will not madly deem that power 
Of Earth may shrive me of the sin 
Unearthly pride hath revell'd in
I have no time to dote or dream: 
You call it hope- that fire of fire! 
It is but agony of desire: 
If I can hope- Oh God! I can
Its fount is holier- more divineI 
would not call thee fool, old man, 
But such is not a gift of thine.
 Know thou the secret of a spirit 
Bow'd from its wild pride into shame. 
O yearning heart! I did inherit
 Thy withering portion with the fame, 
The searing glory which hath shone 
Amid the jewels of my throne, 
Halo of Hell! and with a pain 
Not Hell shall make me fear againO 
craving heart, for the lost flowers 
And sunshine of my summer hours! 
The undying voice of that dead time, 
With its interminable chime, 
Rings, in the spirit of a spell, 
Upon thy emptiness- a knell.
 I have not always been as now: 
The fever'd diadem on my brow 
I claim'd and won usurpingly
Hath not the same fierce heirdom given 
Rome to the Caesar- this to me? 
The heritage of a kingly mind, 
And a proud spirit which hath striven 
Triumphantly with human kind.
 On mountain soil I first drew life: 
The mists of the Taglay have shed 
 Nightly their dews upon my head, 
And, I believe, the winged strife 
And tumult of the headlong air 
Have nestled in my very hair.
 So late from Heaven- that dew- it fell 
(Mid dreams of an unholy night) 
Upon me with the touch of Hell, 
While the red flashing of the light
 From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er, 
Appeared to my half-closing eye 
The pageantry of monarchy,
 And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar 
Came hurriedly upon me, telling 
Of human battle, where my voice, 
My own voice, silly child!- was swelling
 (O! how my spirit would rejoice, 
And leap within me at the cry) 
The battle-cry of Victory!
 The rain came down upon my head 
Unshelter'd- and the heavy wind 
Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.
 It was but man, I thought, who shed 
Laurels upon me: and the rushThe 
torrent of the chilly air
 Gurgled within my ear the crush 
Of empires- with the captive's prayerThe 
hum of suitors- and the tone 
Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.
 My passions, from that hapless hour, 
Usurp'd a tyranny which men 
Have deem'd, since I have reach'd to power, 
My innate nature- be it so: 
But father, there liv'd one who, then, 
Then- in my boyhood- when their fire 
Burn'd with a still intenser glow,
 (For passion must, with youth, expire) 
E'en then who knew this iron heart 
In woman's weakness had a part. 
 I have no words- alas!- to tell 
The loveliness of loving well! 
Nor would I now attempt to trace 
The more than beauty of a face 
Whose lineaments, upon my mind, 
Are- shadows on th' unstable wind: 
Thus I remember having dwelt
 Some page of early lore upon, 
With loitering eye, till I have felt 
The letters- with their meaning- melt
 To fantasies- with none.
 O, she was worthy of all love! 
Love- as in infancy was mine'
Twas such as angel minds above 
Might envy; her young heart the shrine 
On which my every hope and thought 
Were incense- then a goodly gift, 
For they were childish and uprightPure- 
as her young example taught: 
Why did I leave it, and, adrift, 
Trust to the fire within, for light?
 We grew in age- and love- together, 
Roaming the forest, and the wild; 
My breast her shield in wintry weather
And when the friendly sunshine smil'd, 
And she would mark the opening skies, 
I saw no Heaven- but in her eyes.
 Young Love's first lesson is- the heart: 
For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles, 
When, from our little cares apart, 
And laughing at her girlish wiles, 
I'd throw me on her throbbing breast, 
And pour my spirit out in tearsThere 
was no need to speak the rest
No need to quiet any fears 
Of her- who ask'd no reason why, 
But turn'd on me her quiet eye!
 Yet more than worthy of the love 
 My spirit struggled with, and strove, 
When, on the mountain peak, alone, 
Ambition lent it a new toneI 
had no being- but in thee:
 The world, and all it did contain 
In the earth- the air- the seaIts 
joy- its little lot of pain 
That was new pleasure- the ideal, 
Dim vanities of dreams by night
And dimmer nothings which were real(
Shadows- and a more shadowy light!)
 Parted upon their misty wings, 
And, so, confusedly, became 
Thine image, and- a name- a name!
 Two separate- yet most intimate things.
 I was ambitious- have you known
 The passion, father? You have not: 
A cottager, I mark'd a throne 
Of half the world as all my own,
 And murmur'd at such lowly lotBut, 
just like any other dream, 
Upon the vapour of the dew 
My own had past, did not the beam
 Of beauty which did while it thro' 
The minute- the hour- the day- oppress 
My mind with double loveliness.
 We walk'd together on the crown 
Of a high mountain which look'd down 
Afar from its proud natural towers
 Of rock and forest, on the hillsThe 
dwindled hills! begirt with bowers, 
And shouting with a thousand rills.
 I spoke to her of power and pride, 
But mystically- in such guise 
That she might deem it nought beside 
The moment's converse; in her eyes 
I read, perhaps too carelesslyA 
mingled feeling with my own-
 The flush on her bright cheek, to me
 Seem'd to become a queenly throne 
Too well that I should let it be
 Light in the wilderness alone.
 I wrapp'd myself in grandeur then,
 And donn'd a visionary crown
Yet it was not that Fantasy
 Had thrown her mantle over meBut 
that, among the rabble- men,
 Lion ambition is chained downAnd 
crouches to a keeper's handNot 
so in deserts where the grandThe 
wild- the terrible conspire 
With their own breath to fan his fire.
 Look 'round thee now on Samarcand!
 Is not she queen of Earth? her pride 
Above all cities? in her hand
 Their destinies? in all beside 
Of glory which the world hath known 
Stands she not nobly and alone? 
Falling- her veriest stepping-stone 
Shall form the pedestal of a throneAnd 
who her sovereign? Timour- he
 Whom the astonished people saw 
Striding o'er empires haughtily
 A diadem'd outlaw!
 O, human love! thou spirit given 
On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven! 
Which fall'st into the soul like rain 
Upon the Siroc-wither'd plain, 
And, failing in thy power to bless, 
But leav'st the heart a wilderness! 
Idea! which bindest life around 
With music of so strange a sound, 
And beauty of so wild a birthFarewell! 
for I have won the Earth.
 When Hope, the eagle that tower'd, could see 
No cliff beyond him in the sky, 
 His pinions were bent droopingly
And homeward turn'd his soften'd eye. 
'Twas sunset: when the sun will part 
There comes a sullenness of heart 
To him who still would look upon 
The glory of the summer sun. 
That soul will hate the ev'ning mist, 
So often lovely, and will list 
To the sound of the coming darkness (known 
To those whose spirits hearken) as one 
Who, in a dream of night, would fly 
But cannot from a danger nigh.
 What tho' the moon- the white moon 
Shed all the splendour of her noon, 
Her smile is chilly, and her beam, 
In that time of dreariness, will seem 
(So like you gather in your breath) 
A portrait taken after death. 
And boyhood is a summer sun 
Whose waning is the dreariest oneFor 
all we live to know is known, 
And all we seek to keep hath flownLet 
life, then, as the day-flower, fall 
With the noon-day beauty- which is all.
 I reach'd my home- my home no more 
For all had flown who made it so. 
I pass'd from out its mossy door,
 And, tho' my tread was soft and low, 
A voice came from the threshold stone 
Of one whom I had earlier known
O, I defy thee, Hell, to show 
On beds of fire that burn below, 
A humbler heart- a deeper woe.
 Father, I firmly do believeI 
know- for Death, who comes for me 
From regions of the blest afar, 
Where there is nothing to deceive, 
Hath left his iron gate ajar, 
And rays of truth you cannot see 
 Are flashing thro' EternityI 
do believe that Eblis hath 
A snare in every human pathElse 
how, when in the holy grove 
I wandered of the idol, Love, 
Who daily scents his snowy wings 
With incense of burnt offerings 
From the most unpolluted things, 
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven 
Above with trellis'd rays from Heaven, 
No mote may shun- no tiniest flyThe 
lightning of his eagle eyeHow 
was it that Ambition crept,
 Unseen, amid the revels there, 
Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt 
In the tangles of Love's very hair? 
The Bells 
I
 Hear the sledges with the bellsSilver 
bells! 
What a world of merriment their melody foretells! 
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
 In the icy air of night! 
While the stars that oversprinkle 
All the heavens, seem to twinkle
 With a crystalline delight; 
Keeping time, time, time, 
In a sort of Runic rhyme, 
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells 
From the bells, bells, bells, bells, 
Bells, bells, bellsFrom 
the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
 II
 Hear the mellow wedding bells, 
Golden bells!
 What a world of happiness their harmony foretells! 
Through the balmy air of night 
How they ring out their delight!
 From the molten-golden notes, 
And an in tune, 
What a liquid ditty floats 
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats 
On the moon! 
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
 What a gush of euphony voluminously wells! 
How it swells! 
How it dwells
 On the Future! how it tells 
Of the rapture that impels 
To the swinging and the ringing 
Of the bells, bells, bells, 
Of the bells, bells, bells,bells, 
Bells, bells, bells-
 To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells! 
III
 Hear the loud alarum bellsBrazen 
bells! 
What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells! 
In the startled ear of night
 How they scream out their affright! 
Too much horrified to speak, 
They can only shriek, shriek,
 Out of tune, 
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, 
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,
 Leaping higher, higher, higher,
 With a desperate desire, 
And a resolute endeavor, 
Now- now to sit or never,
 By the side of the pale-faced moon. 
Oh, the bells, bells, bells! 
What a tale their terror tells
 Of Despair! 
How they clang, and clash, and roar! 
What a horror they outpour
 On the bosom of the palpitating air!
 Yet the ear it fully knows, 
By the twanging, 
And the clanging,
 How the danger ebbs and flows:
 Yet the ear distinctly tells, 
In the jangling, 
And the wrangling,
 How the danger sinks and swells, 
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bellsOf 
the bellsOf 
the bells, bells, bells,bells, 
Bells, bells, bellsIn 
the clamor and the clangor of the bells!
 IV
 Hear the tolling of the bells-
 Iron Bells!
 What a world of solemn thought their monody compels! 
In the silence of the night, 
How we shiver with affright
 At the melancholy menace of their tone! 
For every sound that floats 
From the rust within their throats
 Is a groan. 
And the people- ah, the peopleThey 
that dwell up in the steeple,
 All Alone 
And who, tolling, tolling, tolling, 
In that muffled monotone, 
Feel a glory in so rolling
 On the human heart a stoneThey 
are neither man nor womanThey 
are neither brute nor human
They are Ghouls: 
And their king it is who tolls; 
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
 Rolls 
A paean from the bells! 
And his merry bosom swells
 With the paean of the bells! 
And he dances, and he yells; 
Keeping time, time, time, 
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
 To the paean of the bells
Of the bells: 
Keeping time, time, time, 
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
 To the throbbing of the bellsOf 
the bells, bells, bellsTo 
the sobbing of the bells; 
Keeping time, time, time, 
As he knells, knells, knells, 
In a happy Runic rhyme, 
To the rolling of the bellsOf 
the bells, bells, bells: 
To the tolling of the bells, 
Of the bells, bells, bells, bellsBells, 
bells, bells-
 To the moaning and the groaning of the bells. 
The Bells - A Collaboration 
The bells! â ah, the bells! 
The little silver bells! 
How fairy-like a melody there floats 
From their throats. â 
From their merry little throats â 
From the silver, tinkling throats 
Of the bells, bells, bells â 
Of the bells! 
The bells! â ah, the bells! 
The heavy iron bells! 
How horrible a monody there floats 
From their throats â 
From their deep-toned throats â 
From their melancholy throats! 
How I shudder at the notes 
Of the bells, bells, bells â 
Of the bells! 
The City In The Sea 
Lo! Death has reared himself a throne 
In a strange city lying alone 
Far down within the dim West, 
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best 
Have gone to their eternal rest. 
There shrines and palaces and towers 
(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!) 
Resemble nothing that is ours. 
Around, by lifting winds forgot, 
Resignedly beneath the sky 
The melancholy waters he.
 No rays from the holy heaven come down 
On the long night-time of that town; 
But light from out the lurid sea 
Streams up the turrets silentlyGleams 
up the pinnacles far and freeUp 
domes- up spires- up kingly hallsUp 
fanes- up Babylon-like wallsUp 
shadowy long-forgotten bowers 
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowersUp 
many and many a marvellous shrine 
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine 
The viol, the violet, and the vine. 
Resignedly beneath the sky 
The melancholy waters lie. 
So blend the turrets and shadows there 
That all seem pendulous in air, 
While from a proud tower in the town 
Death looks gigantically down.
 There open fanes and gaping graves 
Yawn level with the luminous waves; 
But not the riches there that lie 
In each idol's diamond eyeNot 
the gaily-jewelled dead 
Tempt the waters from their bed; 
For no ripples curl, alas! 
Along that wilderness of glass-
 No swellings tell that winds may be 
Upon some far-off happier seaNo 
heavings hint that winds have been 
On seas less hideously serene.
 But lo, a stir is in the air! 
The wave- there is a movement there! 
As if the towers had thrust aside, 
In slightly sinking, the dull tideAs 
if their tops had feebly given 
A void within the filmy Heaven. 
The waves have now a redder glowThe 
hours are breathing faint and lowAnd 
when, amid no earthly moans, 
Down, down that town shall settle hence, 
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones, 
Shall do it reverence. 
The City Of Sin 
LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne 
In a strange city, all alone, 
Far down within the dim west â 
Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best, 
Have gone to their eternal rest. 
? 
There shrines, and palaces, and towers 
Are â not like any thing of ours â 
Oh no! â O no! â ours never loom 
To heaven with that ungodly gloom! 
Time-eaten towers that tremble not! 
Resemble nothing that is ours. 
Around, by lifting winds forgot, 
Resignedly beneath the sky 
The melancholy waters lie. 
? 
No holy rays from heaven come down 
On the long night-time of that town, 
But light from out the lurid sea 
Streams up the turrets silently â 
Up thrones â up long-forgotten bowers 
Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers â 
Up domes â up spires â up kingly halls â 
Up fanes â up Babylon-like walls â 
Up many a melancholy shrine 
Whose entablatures intertwine 
The mask â the viol â and the vine. 
? 
There open temples â open graves 
Are on a level with the waves â 
But not the riches there that lie 
In each idol's diamond eye, 
Not the gaily-jewell'd dead 
Tempt the waters from their bed: 
For no ripples curl, alas! 
Along that wilderness of glass â 
No swellings hint that winds may be 
Upon a far-off happier sea: 
So blend the turrets and shadows there 
That all seem pendulous in air, 
While from the high towers of the town 
Death looks gigantically down. 
? 
But lo! a stir is in the air! 
The wave â there is a ripple there! 
As if the towers had thrown aside, 
In slightly sinking, the dull tide â 
As if the turret-tops had given 
A vacuum in the filmy heaven. 
The waves have now a redder glow â 
The very hours are breathing low â 
And when, amid no earthly moans, 
Down, down, that town shall settle hence, 
All Hades, from a thousand thrones, 
Shall do it reverence, 
And Death to some more happy clime 
Shall give his undivided time. 
The Coliseum 
Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary 
Of lofty contemplation left to Time 
By buried centuries of pomp and power! 
At length- at length- after so many days 
Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst, 
(Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,) 
I kneel, an altered and an humble man, 
Amid thy shadows, and so drink within 
My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!
 Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld! 
Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night! 
I feel ye now- I feel ye in your strengthO 
spells more sure than e'er Judaean king 
Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane! 
O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee 
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!
 Here, where a hero fell, a column falls! 
Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold, 
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat! 
Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair 
Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle! 
Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled, 
Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home, 
Lit by the wan light of the horned moon, 
The swift and silent lizard of the stones!
 But stay! these walls- these ivy-clad arcadesThese 
moldering plinths- these sad and blackened shaftsThese 
vague entablatures- this crumbling friezeThese 
shattered cornices- this wreck- this ruinThese 
stones- alas! these grey stones- are they allAll 
of the famed, and the colossal left 
By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?
 'Not all'- the Echoes answer me- 'not all! 
Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever 
From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise, 
 As melody from Memnon to the Sun. 
We rule the hearts of mightiest men- we rule 
With a despotic sway all giant minds. 
We are not impotent- we pallid stones. 
Not all our power is gone- not all our fameNot 
all the magic of our high renownNot 
all the wonder that encircles usNot 
all the mysteries that in us lieNot 
all the memories that hang upon 
And cling around about us as a garment, 
Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.' 
The Conqueror Worm 
Lo! 'tis a gala night 
Within the lonesome latter years! 
An angel throng, bewinged, bedight 
In veils, and drowned in tears, 
Sit in a theatre, to see 
A play of hopes and fears, 
While the orchestra breathes fitfully 
The music of the spheres.
 Mimes, in the form of God on high, 
Mutter and mumble low, 
And hither and thither flyMere 
puppets they, who come and go 
At bidding of vast formless things 
That shift the scenery to and fro, 
Flapping from out their Condor wings 
Invisible Woe!
 That motley drama- oh, be sure 
It shall not be forgot! 
With its Phantom chased for evermore, 
By a crowd that seize it not, 
Through a circle that ever returneth in 
To the self-same spot, 
And much of Madness, and more of Sin, 
And Horror the soul of the plot.
 But see, amid the mimic rout 
A crawling shape intrude! 
A blood-red thing that writhes from out 
The scenic solitude! 
It writhes!- it writhes!- with mortal pangs 
The mimes become its food, 
And seraphs sob at vermin fangs 
In human gore imbued.
 Out- out are the lights- out all! 
And, over each quivering form, 
The curtain, a funeral pall, 
 Comes down with the rush of a storm, 
While the angels, all pallid and wan, 
Uprising, unveiling, affirm 
That the play is the tragedy, 'Man,' 
And its hero the Conqueror Worm. 
The Divine Right Of Kings 
The only king by right divine 
Is Ellen King, and were she mine 
I'd strive for liberty no more, 
But hug the glorious chains I wore. 
Her bosom is an ivory throne, 
Where tyrant virtue reigns alone ; 
No subject vice dare interfere, 
To check the power that governs here. 
O! would she deign to rule my fate, 
I'd worship Kings and kingly state, 
And hold this maxim all life long, 
The King â my King â can do no wrong. 
The Forest Reverie 
'Tis said that when 
The hands of men 
Tamed this primeval wood, 
And hoary trees with groans of woe, 
Like warriors by an unknown foe, 
Were in their strength subdued, 
The virgin Earth Gave instant birth 
To springs that ne'er did flow 
That in the sun Did rivulets run, 
And all around rare flowers did blow 
The wild rose pale Perfumed the gale 
And the queenly lily adown the dale 
(Whom the sun and the dew 
And the winds did woo), 
With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew. 
So when in tears 
The love of years 
Is wasted like the snow, 
And the fine fibrils of its life 
By the rude wrong of instant strife 
Are broken at a blow 
Within the heart 
Do springs upstart 
Of which it doth now know, 
And strange, sweet dreams, 
Like silent streams 
That from new fountains overflow, 
With the earlier tide 
Of rivers glide 
Deep in the heart whose hope has died-Quenching 
the fires its ashes hide,-Its 
ashes, whence will spring and grow 
Sweet flowers, ere long, 
The rare and radiant flowers of song! 
The Happiest Day, The Happiest Hour 
The happiest day- the happiest hour 
My sear'd and blighted heart hath known, 
The highest hope of pride and power, 
I feel hath flown.
 Of power! said I? yes! such I ween; 
But they have vanish'd long, alas! 
The visions of my youth have been
But let them pass.
 And, pride, what have I now with thee? 
Another brow may even inherit 
The venom thou hast pour'd on me 
Be still, my spirit!
 The happiest day- the happiest hour 
Mine eyes shall see- have ever seen, 
The brightest glance of pride and power, 
I feel- have been:
 But were that hope of pride and power 
Now offer'd with the pain 
Even then I felt- that brightest hour 
I would not live again:
 For on its wing was dark alloy, 
And, as it flutter'd- fell 
An essence- powerful to destroy 
A soul that knew it well. 
The Haunted Palace 
In the greenest of our valleys 
By good angels tenanted, 
Once a fair and stately palaceRadiant 
palace- reared its head. 
In the monarch Thought's dominionIt 
stood there! 
Never seraph spread a pinion 
Over fabric half so fair!
 Banners yellow, glorious, golden, 
On its roof did float and flow, 
(This- all this- was in the olden 
Time long ago,) 
And every gentle air that dallied, 
In that sweet day, 
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, 
A winged odor went away.
 Wanderers in that happy valley, 
Through two luminous windows, saw 
Spirits moving musically, 
To a lute's well-tuned law, 
Round about a throne where, sitting 
(Porphyrogene!) 
In state his glory well-befitting, 
The ruler of the realm was seen.
 And all with pearl and ruby glowing 
Was the fair palace door, 
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing, 
And sparkling evermore, 
A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty 
Was but to sing, 
In voices of surpassing beauty, 
The wit and wisdom of their king.
 But evil things, in robes of sorrow, 
Assailed the monarch's high estate. 
(Ah, let us mourn!- for never morrow 
 Shall dawn upon him desolate!) 
And round about his home the glory 
That blushed and bloomed, 
Is but a dim-remembered story 
Of the old time entombed.
 And travellers, now, within that valley, 
Through the red-litten windows see 
Vast forms, that move fantastically 
To a discordant melody, 
While, like a ghastly rapid river, 
Through the pale door 
A hideous throng rush out forever 
And laugh- but smile no more.
 -THE END. 
The Lake 
In spring of youth it was my lot 
To haunt of the wide world a spot 
The which I could not love the lessSo 
lovely was the loneliness 
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound, 
And the tall pines that towered around.
 But when the Night had thrown her pall 
Upon that spot, as upon all, 
And the mystic wind went by 
Murmuring in melodyThen- 
ah then I would awake 
To the terror of the lone lake.
 Yet that terror was not fright, 
But a tremulous delightA 
feeling not the jewelled mine 
Could teach or bribe me to defineNor 
Love- although the Love were thine.
 Death was in that poisonous wave, 
And in its gulf a fitting grave 
For him who thence could solace bring 
To his lone imaginingWhose 
solitary soul could make 
An Eden of that dim lake. 
The Raven 
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, 
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, 
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, 
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. 
''Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber doorOnly 
this, and nothing more.'
 Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
 And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow 
From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name LenoreNameless 
here for evermore.
 And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
 Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; 
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, 
''Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;This 
it is, and nothing more.'
 Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
 'Sir,' said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; 
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, 
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
 That I scarce was sure I heard you'- here I opened wide the door;Darkness 
there, and nothing more.
 Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, 
fearing,
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; 
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, 
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore!'
 This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, 'Lenore!'Merely 
this, and nothing more.
 Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, 
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. 
'Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice: 
 Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery exploreLet 
my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;'
Tis the wind and nothing more.'
 Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and 
flutter, 
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; 
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed 
he; 
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber doorPerched 
upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber doorPerched, 
and sat, and nothing more.
 Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, 
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore. 
'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no 
craven, 
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shoreTell 
me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!' 
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'
 Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
 Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore; 
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being 
Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, 
With such name as 'Nevermore.'
 But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. 
Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he flutteredTill 
I scarcely more than muttered, 'other friends have flown
 beforeOn 
the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.' 
Then the bird said, 'Nevermore.'
 Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
 'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store, 
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster 
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore 
Of 'Never- nevermore'.' 
 But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, 
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and
 door; 
Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking 
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore 
Meant in croaking 'Nevermore.'
 This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
 To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; 
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining 
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
 But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er, 
She shall press, ah, nevermore!
 Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer 
Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor. 
'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he 
hath sent thee 
Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore! 
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!' 
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'
 'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or 
devil!
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, 
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchantedOn 
this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore
Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!' 
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'
 'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or 
devil!
 By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adoreTell 
this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, 
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.' 
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'
 'Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,' I shrieked, 
upstarting-
 'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! 
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! 
Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!
 Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my 
door!' 
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'
 And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
 On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; 
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, 
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the
 floor; 
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor 
Shall be lifted- nevermore! 
The Sleeper 
At midnight, in the month of June, 
I stand beneath the mystic moon. 
An opiate vapor, dewy, dim, 
Exhales from out her golden rim, 
And, softly dripping, drop by drop, 
Upon the quiet mountain top, 
Steals drowsily and musically 
Into the universal valley. 
The rosemary nods upon the grave; 
The lily lolls upon the wave; 
Wrapping the fog about its breast, 
The ruin molders into rest; 
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake 
A conscious slumber seems to take, 
And would not, for the world, awake. 
All Beauty sleeps!- and lo! where lies 
Irene, with her Destinies!
 O, lady bright! can it be rightThis 
window open to the night? 
The wanton airs, from the tree-top, 
Laughingly through the lattice dropThe 
bodiless airs, a wizard rout, 
Flit through thy chamber in and out, 
And wave the curtain canopy 
So fitfully- so fearfullyAbove 
the closed and fringed lid 
'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid, 
That, o'er the floor and down the wall, 
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall! 
Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear? 
Why and what art thou dreaming here? 
Sure thou art come O'er far-off seas, 
A wonder to these garden trees! 
Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress, 
Strange, above all, thy length of tress, 
And this all solemn silentness!
 The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, 
 Which is enduring, so be deep! 
Heaven have her in its sacred keep! 
This chamber changed for one more holy, 
This bed for one more melancholy, 
I pray to God that she may lie 
For ever with unopened eye, 
While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!
 My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep 
As it is lasting, so be deep! 
Soft may the worms about her creep! 
Far in the forest, dim and old, 
For her may some tall vault unfoldSome 
vault that oft has flung its black 
And winged panels fluttering back, 
Triumphant, o'er the crested palls, 
Of her grand family funeralsSome 
sepulchre, remote, alone, 
Against whose portal she hath thrown, 
In childhood, many an idle stoneSome 
tomb from out whose sounding door 
She ne'er shall force an echo more, 
Thrilling to think, poor child of sin! 
It was the dead who groaned within. 
The Valley Of Unrest 
Once it smiled a silent dell 
Where the people did not dwell; 
They had gone unto the wars, 
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars, 
Nightly, from their azure towers, 
To keep watch above the flowers, 
In the midst of which all day 
The red sunlight lazily lay. 
Now each visitor shall confess 
The sad valley's restlessness. 
Nothing there is motionlessNothing 
save the airs that brood 
Over the magic solitude. 
Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees 
That palpitate like the chill seas 
Around the misty Hebrides! 
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven 
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven 
Uneasily, from morn till even, 
Over the violets there that lie 
In myriad types of the human eyeOver 
the lilies there that wave 
And weep above a nameless grave! 
They wave:- from out their fragrant tops 
Eternal dews come down in drops. 
They weep:- from off their delicate stems 
Perennial tears descend in gems. 
The Village Street
 In these rapid, restless shadows, 
Once I walked at eventide, 
When a gentle, silent maiden,
 Walked in beauty at my side. 
She alone there walked beside me 
All in beauty, like a bride. 
Pallidly the moon was shining
 On the dewy meadows nigh; 
On the silvery, silent rivers, 
On the mountains far and high,-On 
the ocean's star-lit waters, 
Where the winds a-weary die.
 Slowly, silently we wandered 
From the open cottage door, 
Underneath the elm's long branches 
To the pavement bending o'er; 
Underneath the mossy willow 
And the dying sycamore.
 With the myriad stars in beauty 
All bedight, the heavens were seen, 
Radiant hopes were bright around me, 
Like the light of stars serene; 
Like the mellow midnight splendor 
Of the Night's irradiate queen.
 Audibly the elm-leaves whispered 
Peaceful, pleasant melodies, 
Like the distant murmured music 
Of unquiet, lovely seas; 
While the winds were hushed in slumber 
In the fragrant flowers and trees.
 Wondrous and unwonted beauty 
Still adorning all did seem, 
While I told my love in fables 
'Neath the willows by the stream; 
Would the heart have kept unspoken 
 Love that was its rarest dream!
 Instantly away we wandered 
In the shadowy twilight tide, 
She, the silent, scornful maiden, 
Walking calmly at my side, 
With a step serene and stately, 
All in beauty, all in pride.
 Vacantly I walked beside her. 
On the earth mine eyes were cast; 
Swift and keen there came unto me 
Bitter memories of the past-On 
me, like the rain in Autumn 
On the dead leaves, cold and fast.
 Underneath the elms we parted, 
By the lowly cottage door; 
One brief word alone was uttered-
Never on our lips before; 
And away I walked forlornly, 
Broken-hearted evermore.
 Slowly, silently I loitered, 
Homeward, in the night, alone; 
Sudden anguish bound my spirit, 
That my youth had never known; 
Wild unrest, like that which cometh 
When the Night's first dream hath flown.
 Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper 
Mad, discordant melodies, 
And keen melodies like shadows 
Haunt the moaning willow trees, 
And the sycamores with laughter 
Mock me in the nightly breeze.
 Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight 
Through the sighing foliage streams; 
And each morning, midnight shadow, 
Shadow of my sorrow seems; 
Strive, O heart, forget thine idol! 
 And, O soul, forget thy dreams! 
To -
The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see 
The wantonest singing birds, 
Are lips- and all thy melody 
Of lip-begotten words
Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined, 
Then desolately fall, 
O God! on my funereal mind 
Like starlight on a pall
Thy heart- thy heart!- I wake and sigh, 
And sleep to dream till day 
Of the truth that gold can never buyOf 
the baubles that it may. 
To -- -
Not long ago, the writer of these lines, 
In the mad pride of intellectuality, 
Maintained "the power of words"- denied that ever 
A thought arose within the human brain 
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue: 
And now, as if in mockery of that boast, 
Two words- two foreign soft dissyllablesItalian 
tones, made only to be murmured 
By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew 
That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill," 
Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart, 
Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought, 
Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions 
Than even seraph harper, Israfel, 
(Who has "the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,") 
Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken. 
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand. 
With thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee, 
I cannot write- I cannot speak or thinkAlas, 
I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling, 
This standing motionless upon the golden 
Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams. 
Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista, 
And thrilling as I see, upon the right, 
Upon the left, and all the way along, 
Amid empurpled vapors, far away 
To where the prospect terminates- thee only. 
To -- -- --. Ulalume: A Ballad 
The skies they were ashen and sober; 
The leaves they were crisped and sereThe 
leaves they were withering and sere;
 It was night in the lonesome October 
Of my most immemorial year; 
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber, 
In the misty mid region of WeirIt 
was down by the dank tarn of Auber, 
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.
 Here once, through an alley Titanic, 
Of cypress, I roamed with my SoulOf 
cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
 There were days when my heart was volcanic 
As the scoriac rivers that rollAs 
the lavas that restlessly roll
 Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek 
In the ultimate climes of the poleThat 
groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek 
In the realms of the boreal pole.
 Our talk had been serious and sober, 
But our thoughts they were palsied and sereOur 
memories were treacherous and sere
For we knew not the month was October, 
And we marked not the night of the year(
Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
 We noted not the dim lake of Auber(
Though once we had journeyed down here), 
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber, 
Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.
 And now, as the night was senescent, 
And star-dials pointed to mornAs 
the star-dials hinted of morn
At the end of our path a liquescent 
And nebulous lustre was born, 
Out of which a miraculous crescent 
Arose with a duplicate horn-
 Astarte's bediamonded crescent 
Distinct with its duplicate horn.
 And I said- 'She is warmer than Dian: 
She rolls through an ether of sighsShe 
revels in a region of sighs:
 She has seen that the tears are not dry on 
These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
 And has come past the stars of the Lion, 
To point us the path to the skiesTo 
the Lethean peace of the skies
Come up, in despite of the Lion, 
To shine on us with her bright eyesCome 
up through the lair of the Lion, 
With love in her luminous eyes.'
 But Psyche, uplifting her finger, 
Said- 'Sadly this star I mistrustHer 
pallor I strangely mistrust:
Oh, hasten!- oh, let us not linger! 
Oh, fly!- let us fly!- for we must.' 
In terror she spoke, letting sink her 
Wings until they trailed in the dust
In agony sobbed, letting sink her 
Plumes till they trailed in the dustTill 
they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.
 I replied- 'This is nothing but dreaming: 
Let us on by this tremulous light! 
Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
 Its Sybilic splendor is beaming 
With Hope and in Beauty to-night:See!- 
it flickers up the sky through the night!
 Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming, 
And be sure it will lead us aright
We safely may trust to a gleaming 
That cannot but guide us aright, 
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.'
 Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her, 
And tempted her out of her gloomAnd 
conquered her scruples and gloom; 
 And we passed to the end of the vista, 
But were stopped by the door of a tombBy 
the door of a legended tomb;
 And I said- 'What is written, sweet sister, 
On the door of this legended tomb?' 
She replied- 'Ulalume- Ulalume'
Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!'
 Then my heart it grew ashen and sober 
As the leaves that were crisped and sereAs 
the leaves that were withering and sere
And I cried- 'It was surely October 
On this very night of last year 
That I journeyed- I journeyed down hereThat 
I brought a dread burden down hereOn 
this night of all nights in the year, 
Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
 Well I know, now, this dim lake of AuberThis 
misty mid region of WeirWell 
I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber, 
This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.' 
To F-
Beloved! amid the earnest woes
 That crowd around my earthly path(
Drear path, alas! where grows 
Not even one lonely rose)
My soul at least a solace hath 
In dreams of thee, and therein knows 
An Eden of bland repose.
 And thus thy memory is to me
 Like some enchanted far-off isle 
In some tumultuous seaSome 
ocean throbbing far and free
 With storms- but where meanwhile 
Serenest skies continually 
Just o'er that one bright island smile. 
To F--S S. O--D 
Thou wouldst be loved?- then let thy heart 
From its present pathway part not! 
Being everything which now thou art, 
Be nothing which thou art not. 
So with the world thy gentle ways, 
Thy grace, thy more than beauty, 
Shall be an endless theme of praise, 
And love- a simple duty. 
To Helen 
Helen, thy beauty is to me 
Like those Nicean barks of yore, 
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea, 
The weary, wayworn wanderer bore 
To his own native shore.
 On desperate seas long wont to roam, 
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, 
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
 To the glory that was Greece 
And the grandeur that was Rome.
 Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche 
How statue-like I see thee stand, 
The agate lamp within thy hand!
 Ah, Psyche, from the regions which 
Are Holy Land! 
To Helen - 1848 
I saw thee once- once only- years ago: 
I must not say how many- but not many. 
It was a July midnight; and from out 
A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring, 
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven, 
There fell a silvery-silken veil of light, 
With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber, 
Upon the upturned faces of a thousand 
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden, 
Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe-
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses 
That gave out, in return for the love-light, 
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death-
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses 
That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted 
By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence. 
Clad all in white, upon a violet bank 
I saw thee half reclining; while the moon 
Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses, 
And on thine own, upturn'd- alas, in sorrow! 
Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight-
Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,) 
That bade me pause before that garden-gate, 
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses? 
No footstep stirred: the hated world an slept, 
Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!- oh, God! 
How my heart beats in coupling those two words!) 
Save only thee and me. I paused- I looked-
And in an instant all things disappeared. 
(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!) 
The pearly lustre of the moon went out: 
The mossy banks and the meandering paths, 
The happy flowers and the repining trees, 
Were seen no more: the very roses' odors 
Died in the arms of the adoring airs. 
All- all expired save thee- save less than thou: 
Save only the divine light in thine eyes-
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes. 
I saw but them- they were the world to me! 
I saw but them- saw only them for hours, 
Saw only them until the moon went down. 
What wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten 
Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres! 
How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope! 
How silently serene a sea of pride! 
How daring an ambition; yet how deep-
How fathomless a capacity for love! 
But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight, 
Into a western couch of thunder-cloud; 
And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees 
Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained; 
They would not go- they never yet have gone; 
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night, 
They have not left me (as my hopes have) since; 
They follow me- they lead me through the years. 
They are my ministers- yet I their slave. 
Their office is to illumine and enkindle-
My duty, to be saved by their bright light, 
And purified in their electric fire, 
And sanctified in their elysian fire. 
They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope), 
And are far up in Heaven- the stars I kneel to 
In the sad, silent watches of my night; 
While even in the meridian glare of day 
I see them still- two sweetly scintillant 
Venuses, unextinguished by the sun! 
To Isadore 
I. Beneath the vine-clad eaves, 
Whose shadows fall before 
Thy lowly cottage door-Under 
the lilac's tremulous leaves-Within 
thy snowy clasped hand
 The purple flowers it bore. 
Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand, 
Like queenly nymph from Fairy-land-Enchantress 
of the flowery wand,
 Most beauteous Isadore! 
II. And when I bade the dream 
Upon thy spirit flee, 
Thy violet eyes to me 
Upturned, did overflowing seem 
With the deep, untold delight
 Of Love's serenity; 
Thy classic brow, like lilies white 
And pale as the Imperial Night 
Upon her throne, with stars bedight,
 Enthralled my soul to thee! 
III. Ah! ever I behold 
Thy dreamy, passionate eyes, 
Blue as the languid skies 
Hung with the sunset's fringe of gold; 
Now strangely clear thine image grows,
 And olden memories 
Are startled from their long repose 
Like shadows on the silent snows 
When suddenly the night-wind blows
 Where quiet moonlight lies. 
IV. Like music heard in dreams, 
Like strains of harps unknown, 
Of birds for ever flown,-Audible 
as the voice of streams 
 That murmur in some leafy dell,
 I hear thy gentlest tone, 
And Silence cometh with her spell 
Like that which on my tongue doth dwell, 
When tremulous in dreams I tell
 My love to thee alone! 
V. In every valley heard, 
Floating from tree to tree, 
Less beautiful to me, 
The music of the radiant bird, 
Than artless accents such as thine
 Whose echoes never flee! 
Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:-For 
uttered in thy tones benign 
(Enchantress!) this rude name of mine
 Doth seem a melody! 
To M-
O! I care not that my earthly lot 
Hath little of Earth in it, 
That years of love have been forgot 
In the fever of a minute:
 I heed not that the desolate 
Are happier, sweet, than I, 
But that you meddle with my fate 
Who am a passer by.
 It is not that my founts of bliss 
Are gushing- strange! with tearsOr 
that the thrill of a single kiss 
Hath palsied many years
'Tis not that the flowers of twenty springs 
Which have wither'd as they rose 
Lie dead on my heart-strings 
With the weight of an age of snows.
 Not that the grass- O! may it thrive! 
On my grave is growing or grownBut 
that, while I am dead yet alive 
I cannot be, lady, alone. 
To M.L.S. 
Of all who hail thy presence as the morningOf 
all to whom thine absence is the nightThe 
blotting utterly from out high heaven 
The sacred sun- of all who, weeping, bless thee 
Hourly for hope- for life- ah! above all, 
For the resurrection of deep-buried faith 
In Truth- in Virtue- in HumanityOf 
all who, on Despair's unhallowed bed 
Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen 
At thy soft-murmured words, "Let there be light!" 
At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled 
In the seraphic glancing of thine eyesOf 
all who owe thee most- whose gratitude 
Nearest resembles worship- oh, remember 
The truest- the most fervently devoted, 
And think that these weak lines are written by himBy 
him who, as he pens them, thrills to think 
His spirit is communing with an angel's. 
To Marie Louise (Shew) 
Of all who hail thy presence as the morning-
Of all to whom thine absence is the night-
The blotting utterly from out high heaven 
The sacred sun- of all who, weeping, bless thee 
Hourly for hope- for life- ah! above all, 
For the resurrection of deep-buried faith 
In Truth- in Virtue- in Humanity-
Of all who, on Despair's unhallowed bed 
Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen 
At thy soft-murmured words, 'Let there be light!' 
At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled

The truest- the most fervently devoted, 
And think that these weak lines are written by him-
By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think 
His spirit is communing with an angel's. 
To My Mother 
Because I feel that, in the Heavens above, 
The angels, whispering to one another, 
Can find, among their burning terms of love, 
None so devotional as that of "Mother," 
Therefore by that dear name I long have called youYou 
who are more than mother unto me, 
And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you 
In setting my Virginia's spirit free. 
My mother- my own mother, who died early, 
Was but the mother of myself; but you 
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly, 
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew 
By that infinity with which my wife 
Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life. 
To One Departed 
Seraph! thy memory is to me 
Like some enchanted far-off isle 
In some tumultuous sea Some 
ocean vexed as it may be 
With storms; but where, meanwhile, 
Serenest skies continually 
Just o'er that one bright island smile. 
For 'mid the earnest cares and woes 
That crowd around my earthly path, 
(Sad path, alas, where grows 
Not even one lonely rose!) 
My soul at least a solace hath 
In dreams of thee; and therein knows 
An Eden of bland repose. 
To One In Paradise 
Thou wast all that to me, love, 
For which my soul did pineA 
green isle in the sea, love, 
A fountain and a shrine, 
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers, 
And all the flowers were mine.
 Ah, dream too bright to last! 
Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise 
But to be overcast! 
A voice from out the Future cries, 
'On! on!'- but o'er the Past 
(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies 
Mute, motionless, aghast!
 For, alas! alas! me 
For me the light of Life is over! 
'No more- no more- no more-'
 (Such language holds the solemn sea 
To the sands upon the shore) 
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree 
Or the stricken eagle soar!
 And all my days are trances, 
And all my nightly dreams 
Are where thy grey eye glances, 
And where thy footstep gleamsIn 
what ethereal dances, 
By what eternal streams. 
To The River -
Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow 
Of crystal, wandering water, 
Thou art an emblem of the glow 
Of beauty- the unhidden heartThe 
playful maziness of art 
In old Alberto's daughter;
 But when within thy wave she looksWhich 
glistens then, and tremblesWhy, 
then, the prettiest of brooks 
Her worshipper resembles; 
For in his heart, as in thy stream, 
Her image deeply liesHis 
heart which trembles at the beam 
Of her soul-searching eyes.

I brought a dread burden down here! 
On this night of all nights in the year, 
Ah, what demon has tempted me here? 
Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber This 
misty mid region of Weir Well 
I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber, This 
ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir."
