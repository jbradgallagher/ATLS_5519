"Faith" Is A Fine Invention 
 
"Faith" is a fine invention 
When Gentlemen can see&mdash; 
But Microscopes are prudent 
In an Emergency. 
"Heaven" Has Different Signs&Mdash;To Me 
 
"Heaven" has different Signs&mdash;to me&mdash; 
Sometimes, I think that Noon 
Is but a symbol of the Place&mdash; 
And when again, at Dawn, 
A mighty look runs round the World 
And settles in the Hills&mdash; 
An Awe if it should be like that 
Upon the Ignorance steals&mdash; 
The Orchard, when the Sun is on&mdash; 
The Triumph of the Birds 
When they together Victory make&mdash; 
Some Carnivals of Clouds&mdash; 
The Rapture of a finished Day&mdash; 
Returning to the West&mdash; 
All these&mdash;remind us of the place 
That Men call "paradise"&mdash; 
Itself be fairer&mdash;we suppose&mdash; 
But how Ourself, shall be 
Adorned, for a Superior Grace&mdash; 
Not yet, our eyes can see&mdash; 
"Heaven"&mdash;Is What I Cannot Reach! 
 
"Heaven"&mdash;is what I cannot reach! 
The Apple on the Tree&mdash; 
Provided it do hopeless&mdash;hang&mdash; 
That&mdash;"Heaven" is&mdash;to Me! 
The Color, on the Cruising Cloud&mdash; 
The interdicted Land&mdash; 
Behind the Hill&mdash;the House behind&mdash; 
There&mdash;Paradise&mdash;is found! 
Her teasing Purples&mdash;Afternoons&mdash; 
The credulous&mdash;decoy&mdash; 
Enamored&mdash;of the Conjuror&mdash; 
That spurned us&mdash;Yesterday! 
"Houses"&Mdash;So The Wise Men Tell Me 
 
"Houses"&mdash;so the Wise Men tell me&mdash; 
"Mansions"! Mansions must be warm! 
Mansions cannot let the tears in, 
Mansions must exclude the storm! 
"Many Mansions," by "his Father," 
I don't know him; snugly built! 
Could the Children find the way there&mdash; 
Some, would even trudge tonight! 
"I Want"&Mdash;It Pleaded&Mdash;All Its Life 
 
"I want"&mdash;it pleaded&mdash;All its life&mdash; 
I want&mdash;was chief it said 
When Skill entreated it&mdash;the last&mdash; 
And when so newly dead&mdash; 
I could not deem it late&mdash;to hear 
That single&mdash;steadfast sigh&mdash; 
The lips had placed as with a "Please" 
Toward Eternity&mdash; 
"Nature" Is What We See 
 
"Nature" is what we see&mdash; 
The Hill&mdash;the Afternoon&mdash; 
Squirrel&mdash;Eclipse&mdash;the Bumble bee&mdash; 
Nay&mdash;Nature is Heaven&mdash; 
Nature is what we hear&mdash; 
The Bobolink&mdash;the Sea&mdash; 
Thunder&mdash;the Cricket&mdash; 
Nay&mdash;Nature is Harmony&mdash; 
Nature is what we know&mdash; 
Yet have no art to say&mdash; 
So impotent Our Wisdom is 
To her Simplicity. 
"Unto Me?" I Do Not Know You 
 
"Unto Me?" I do not know you&mdash; 
Where may be your House? 
"I am Jesus&mdash;Late of Judea&mdash; 
Now&mdash;of Paradise"&mdash; 
Wagons&mdash;have you&mdash;to convey me? 
This is far from Thence&mdash; 
"Arms of Mine&mdash;sufficient Phaeton&mdash; 
Trust Omnipotence"&mdash; 
I am spotted&mdash;"I am Pardon"&mdash; 
I am small&mdash;"The Least 
Is esteemed in Heaven the Chiefest&mdash; 
Occupy my House"&mdash; 
"Why Do I Love" You, Sir? 
 
"Why do I love" You, Sir? 
Because&mdash; 
The Wind does not require the Grass 
To answer&mdash;Wherefore when He pass 
She cannot keep Her place. 
Because He knows&mdash;and 
Do not You&mdash; 
And We know not&mdash; 
Enough for Us 
The Wisdom it be so&mdash; 
The Lightning&mdash;never asked an Eye 
Wherefore it shut&mdash;when He was by&mdash; 
Because He knows it cannot speak&mdash; 
And reasons not contained&mdash; 
&mdash;Of Talk&mdash; 
There be&mdash;preferred by Daintier Folk&mdash; 
The Sunrise&mdash;Sire&mdash;compelleth Me&mdash; 
Because He's Sunrise&mdash;and I see&mdash; 
Therefore&mdash;Then&mdash; 
I love Thee&mdash; 
&quot;470&quot; 
How good—to be alive! 
How infinite—to be 
Alive—two-fold—The Birth I had 
And this—besides, in—Thee! 
A Bird Came Down 
A bird came down the walk: 
He did not know I saw; 
He bit an angle-worm in halves 
And ate the fellow, raw. 
And then he drank a dew 
From a convenient grass, 
And then hopped sidewise to the wall 
To let a beetle pass. 
He glanced with rapid eyes 
That hurried all abroad,They 
looked like frightened beads, I thought; 
He stirred his velvet head 
Like one in danger; cautious, 
I offered him a crumb, 
And he unrolled his feathers 
And rowed him softer home 
Than oars divide the ocean, 
Too silver for a seam, 
Or butterflies, off banks of noon, 
Leap, splashless, as they swim. 
A Book 
There is no frigate like a book 
To take us lands away, 
Nor any coursers like a page 
Of prancing poetry. 
This traverse may the poorest take 
Without oppress of toll; 
How frugal is the chariot 
That bears a human soul! 
A Burdock&Mdash;Clawed My Gown 
 
A Burdock&mdash;clawed my Gown&mdash; 
Not Burdock's&mdash;blame&mdash; 
But mine&mdash; 
Who went too near 
The Burdock's Den&mdash; 
A Bog&mdash;affronts my shoe&mdash; 
What else have Bogs&mdash;to do&mdash; 
The only Trade they know&mdash; 
The splashing Men! 
Ah, pity&mdash;then! 
'Tis Minnows can despise! 
The Elephant's&mdash;calm eyes 
Look further on! 
A Charm Invests A Face 
 
A Charm invests a face 
Imperfectly beheld— 
The Lady dare not lift her Veil 
For fear it be dispelled— 
But peers beyond her mesh— 
And wishes—and denies— 
Lest Interview—annul a want 
That Image—satisfies— 
A chilly Peace infests the Grass 
A chilly Peace infests the Grass 
The Sun respectful lies Not 
any Trance of industry 
These shadows scrutinize 
Whose Allies go no more astray 
For service or for Glee But 
all mankind deliver here 
From whatsoever sea 
A Clock Stopped -- Not The Mantel's 
A clock stopped -- not the mantel's 
Geneva's farthest skill 
Can't put the puppet bowing 
That just now dangled still. 
An awe came on the trinket! 
The figures hunched with pain, 
Then quivered out of decimals 
Into degreeless noon. 
It will not stir for doctors, 
This pendulum of snow; 
The shopman importunes it, 
While cool, concernless No 
Nods from the gilded pointers, 
Nods from seconds slim, 
Decades of arrogance between 
The dial life and him. 
A Cloud Withdrew From The Sky 
 
A Cloud withdrew from the Sky 
Superior Glory be 
But that Cloud and its Auxiliaries 
Are forever lost to me 
Had I but further scanned 
Had I secured the Glow 
In an Hermetic Memory 
It had availed me now. 
Never to pass the Angel 
With a glance and a Bow 
Till I am firm in Heaven 
Is my intention now. 
A Coffin—is A Small Domain 
A Coffin—is a small Domain, 
Yet able to contain 
A Citizen of Paradise 
In it diminished Plane. 
A Grave—is a restricted Breadth— 
Yet ampler than the Sun— 
And all the Seas He populates 
And Lands He looks upon 
To Him who on its small Repose 
Bestows a single Friend— 
Circumference without Relief— 
Or Estimate—or End— 
A Counterfeit -a Plated Person 
A Counterfeit -a Plated Person I 
would not be Whatever 
strata of Iniquity 
My Nature underlie Truth 
is good Health -and Safety, and the Sky. 
How meagre, what an Exile -is a Lie, 
And Vocal -when we die 
A Darting Fear&Mdash;A Pomp&Mdash;A Tear 
 
A darting fear&mdash;a pomp&mdash;a tear&mdash; 
A waking on a morn 
To find that what one waked for, 
Inhales the different dawn. 
A Day! Help! Help! Another Day! 
 
A Day! Help! Help! Another Day! 
Your prayers, oh Passer by! 
From such a common ball as this 
Might date a Victory! 
From marshallings as simple 
The flags of nations swang. 
Steady&mdash;my soul: What issues 
Upon thine arrow hang! 
A Death Blow Is A Life Blow To Some 
 
A Death blow is a Life blow to Some 
Who till they died, did not alive become&mdash; 
Who had they lived, had died but when 
They died, Vitality begun. 
A Door Just Opened On A Street 
A door just opened on a street-I, 
lost, was passing by-
An instant's width of warmth disclosed 
And wealth, and company. 
The door as sudden shut, and I, 
I, lost, was passing by,-
Lost doubly, but by contrast most, 
Enlightening misery. 
A Doubt If It Be Us 
 
A doubt if it be Us 
Assists the staggering Mind 
In an extremer Anguish 
Until it footing find. 
An Unreality is lent, 
A merciful Mirage 
That makes the living possible 
While it suspends the lives. 
A Drop Fell On The Apple Tree 
A drop fell on the apple tree 
Another on the roof; 
A half a dozen kissed the eaves, 
And made the gables laugh. 
A few went out to help the brook, 
That went to help the sea. 
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls, 
What necklaces could be! 
The dust replaced in hoisted roa 
The birds jocoser sung; 
The sunshine threw his hat away, 
The orchards spangles hung. 
The breezes brought dejected 
And bathed them in the glee; 
The East put out a single flag, 
And signed the fete away. 
A Dying Tiger&Mdash;Moaned For Drink 
 
A Dying Tiger&mdash;moaned for Drink&mdash; 
I hunted all the Sand&mdash; 
I caught the Dripping of a Rock 
And bore it in my Hand&mdash; 
His Mighty Balls&mdash;in death were thick&mdash; 
But searching&mdash;I could see 
A Vision on the Retina 
Of Water&mdash;and of me&mdash; 
'Twas not my blame&mdash;who sped too slow&mdash; 
'Twas not his blame&mdash;who died 
While I was reaching him&mdash; 
But 'twas&mdash;the fact that He was dead&mdash; 
A Feather From The Whippoorwill 
 
A feather from the Whippoorwill 
That everlasting&mdash;sings! 
Whose galleries&mdash;are Sunrise&mdash; 
Whose Opera&mdash;the Springs&mdash; 
Whose Emerald Nest the Ages spin 
Of mellow&mdash;murmuring thread&mdash; 
Whose Beryl Egg, what Schoolboys hunt 
In "Recess"&mdash;Overhead! 
A First Mute Coming 
 
A first Mute Coming&mdash; 
In the Stranger's House&mdash; 
A first fair Going&mdash; 
When the Bells rejoice&mdash; 
A first Exchange&mdash;of 
What hath mingled&mdash;been&mdash; 
For Lot&mdash;exhibited to 
Faith&mdash;alone&mdash; 
A Fuzzy Fellow, Without Feet 
 
A fuzzy fellow, without feet, 
Yet doth exceeding run! 
Of velvet, is his Countenance, 
And his Complexion, dun! 
Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass! 
Sometime, upon a bough, 
From which he doth descend in plush 
Upon the Passer-by! 
All this in summer. 
But when winds alarm the Forest Folk, 
He taketh Damask Residence&mdash; 
And struts in sewing silk! 
Then, finer than a Lady, 
Emerges in the spring! 
A Feather on each shoulder! 
You'd scarce recognize him! 
By Men, yclept Caterpillar! 
By me! But who am I, 
To tell the pretty secret 
Of the Butterfly! 
A Great Hope Fell 
A great Hope fell 
You heard no noise 
The Ruin was within 
Oh cunning wreck that told no tale 
And let no Witness in 
The mind was built for mighty Freight 
For dread occasion planned 
How often foundering at Sea 
Ostensibly, on Land 
A not admitting of the wound 
Until it grew so wide 
That all my Life had entered it 
And there were troughs beside 
A closing of the simple lid 
That opened to the sun 
Until the tender Carpenter 
Perpetual nail it down 
A Happy Lip&Mdash;Breaks Sudden 
 
A happy lip&mdash;breaks sudden&mdash; 
It doesn't state you how 
It contemplated&mdash;smiling&mdash; 
Just consummated&mdash;now&mdash; 
But this one, wears its merriment 
So patient&mdash;like a pain&mdash; 
Fresh gilded&mdash;to elude the eyes 
Unqualified, to scan&mdash; 
A House Upon The Height 
 
A House upon the Height&mdash; 
That Wagon never reached&mdash; 
No Dead, were ever carried down&mdash; 
No Peddler's Cart&mdash;approached&mdash; 
Whose Chimney never smoked&mdash; 
Whose Windows&mdash;Night and Morn&mdash; 
Caught Sunrise first&mdash;and Sunset&mdash;last&mdash; 
Then&mdash;held an Empty Pane&mdash; 
Whose fate&mdash;Conjecture knew&mdash; 
No other neighbor&mdash;did&mdash; 
And what it was&mdash;we never lisped&mdash; 
Because He&mdash;never told&mdash; 
A Lady Red&Mdash;Amid The Hill 
 
A Lady red&mdash;amid the Hill 
Her annual secret keeps! 
A Lady white, within the Field 
In placid Lily sleeps! 
The tidy Breezes, with their Brooms&mdash; 
Sweep vale&mdash;and hill&mdash;and tree! 
Prithee, My pretty Housewives! 
Who may expected be? 
The Neighbors do not yet suspect! 
The Woods exchange a smile! 
Orchard, and Buttercup, and Bird&mdash; 
In such a little while! 
And yet, how still the Landscape stands! 
How nonchalant the Hedge! 
As if the "Resurrection" 
Were nothing very strange! 
A lane of Yellow led the eye 
A lane of Yellow led the eye 
Unto a Purple Wood 
Whose soft inhabitants to be 
Surpasses solitude 
If Bird the silence contradict 
Or flower presume to show 
In that low summer of the West 
Impossible to know 
A Light Exists In Spring 
A light exists in spring 
Not present on the year 
At any other period. 
When March is scarcely here 
A color stands abroad 
On solitary hills 
That science cannot overtake, 
But human naturefeels. 
It waits upon the lawn; 
It shows the furthest tree 
Upon the furthest slope we know; 
It almost speaks to me. 
Then, as horizons step, 
Or noons report away, 
Without the formula of sound, 
It passes, and we stay: 
A quality of loss 
Affecting our content, 
As trade had suddenly encroached 
Upon a sacrament. 
A Little Bread&Mdash;A Crust&Mdash;A Crumb 
 
A little bread&mdash;a crust&mdash;a crumb&mdash; 
A little trust&mdash;a demijohn&mdash; 
Can keep the soul alive&mdash; 
Not portly, mind! but breathing&mdash;warm&mdash; 
Conscious&mdash;as old Napoleon, 
The night before the Crown! 
A modest lot&mdash;A fame petite&mdash; 
A brief Campaign of sting and sweet 
Is plenty! Is enough! 
A Sailor's business is the shore! 
A Soldier's&mdash;balls! Who asketh more, 
Must seek the neighboring life! 
A Little Dog That Wags His Tail 
A little Dog that wags his tail 
And knows no other joy 
Of such a little Dog am I 
Reminded by a Boy 
Who gambols all the living Day 
Without an earthly cause 
Because he is a little Boy 
I honestly suppose 
The Cat that in the Corner dwells 
Her martial Day forgot 
The Mouse but a Tradition now 
Of her desireless Lot 
Another class remind me 
Who neither please nor play 
But not to make a 'bit of noise' 
Beseech each little Boy 
A Little East Of Jordan 
 
A little East of Jordan, 
Evangelists record, 
A Gymnast and an Angel 
Did wrestle long and hard&mdash; 
Till morning touching mountain&mdash; 
And Jacob, waxing strong, 
The Angel begged permission 
To Breakfast&mdash;to return&mdash; 
Not so, said cunning Jacob! 
"I will not let thee go 
Except thou bless me"&mdash;Stranger! 
The which acceded to&mdash; 
Light swung the silver fleeces 
"Peniel" Hills beyond, 
And the bewildered Gymnast 
Found he had worsted God! 
A little Madness in the Spring 
A little Madness in the Spring 
Is wholesome even for the King, 
But God be with the Clown Who 
ponders this tremendous scene This 
whole Experiment of Green As 
if it were his own! 
A Little Road Not Made Man 
A little road not made of man, 
Enabled of the eye, 
Accessible to thill of bee, 
Or cart of butterfly. 
If town it have, beyond itself, 
'T is that I cannot say; 
I only sigh,--no vehicle 
Bears me along that way. 
A Little Snow Was Here And There 
A little Snow was here and there 
Disseminated in her Hair Since 
she and I had met and played 
Decade had gathered to Decade 
But Time had added not obtained 
Impregnable the Rose 
For summer too indelible 
Too obdurate for Snows 
A Long, Long Sleep, A Famous Sleep 
A long, long sleep, a famous sleep 
That makes no show for dawn 
By strech of limb or stir of lid, -An 
independent one. 
Was ever idleness like this? 
Within a hut of stone 
To bask the centuries away 
Nor once look up for noon? 
A Loss Of Something Ever Felt I 
 
A loss of something ever felt I&mdash; 
The first that I could recollect 
Bereft I was&mdash;of what I knew not 
Too young that any should suspect 
A Mourner walked among the children 
I notwithstanding went about 
As one bemoaning a Dominion 
Itself the only Prince cast out&mdash; 
Elder, Today, a session wiser 
And fainter, too, as Wiseness is&mdash; 
I find myself still softly searching 
For my Delinguent Palaces&mdash; 
And a Suspicion, like a Finger 
Touches my Forehead now and then 
That I am looking oppositely 
For the site of the Kingdom of Heaven&mdash; 
A Man May Make A Remark 
 
A Man may make a Remark&mdash; 
In itself&mdash;a quiet thing 
That may furnish the Fuse unto a Spark 
In dormant nature&mdash;lain&mdash; 
Let us deport&mdash;with skill&mdash; 
Let us discourse&mdash;with care&mdash; 
Powder exists in Charcoal&mdash; 
Before it exists in Fire. 
A Mien To Move A Queen 
 
A Mien to move a Queen&mdash; 
Half Child&mdash;Half Heroine&mdash; 
An Orleans in the Eye 
That puts its manner by 
For humbler Company 
When none are near 
Even a Tear&mdash; 
Its frequent Visitor&mdash; 
A Bonnet like a Duke&mdash; 
And yet a Wren's Peruke 
Were not so shy 
Of Goer by&mdash; 
And Hands&mdash;so slight&mdash; 
They would elate a Sprite 
With Merriment&mdash; 
A Voice that Alters&mdash;Low 
And on the Ear can go 
Like Let of Snow&mdash; 
Or shift supreme&mdash; 
As tone of Realm 
On Subjects Diadem&mdash; 
Too small&mdash;to fear&mdash; 
Too distant&mdash;to endear&mdash; 
And so Men Compromise 
And just&mdash;revere&mdash; 
A Moth The Hue Of This 
 
A Moth the hue of this 
Haunts Candles in Brazil. 
Nature's Experience would make 
Our Reddest Second pale. 
Nature is fond, I sometimes think, 
Of Trinkets, as a Girl. 
A Murmur In The Trees&Mdash;To Note 
 
A Murmur in the Trees&mdash;to note&mdash; 
Not loud enough&mdash;for Wind&mdash; 
A Star&mdash;not far enough to seek&mdash; 
Nor near enough&mdash;to find&mdash; 
A long&mdash;long Yellow&mdash;on the Lawn&mdash; 
A Hubbub&mdash;as of feet&mdash; 
Not audible&mdash;as Ours&mdash;to Us&mdash; 
But dapperer&mdash;More Sweet&mdash; 
A Hurrying Home of little Men 
To Houses unperceived&mdash; 
All this&mdash;and more&mdash;if I should tell&mdash; 
Would never be believed&mdash; 
Of Robins in the Trundle bed 
How many I espy 
Whose Nightgowns could not hide the Wings&mdash; 
Although I heard them try&mdash; 
But then I promised ne'er to tell&mdash; 
How could I break My Word? 
So go your Way&mdash;and I'll go Mine&mdash; 
No fear you'll miss the Road. 
A Narrow Fellow In The Grass 
A narrow fellow in the grass 
Occasionally rides; 
You may have met him,--did you not, 
His notice sudden is. 
The grass divides as with a comb, 
A spotted shaft is seen; 
And then it closes at your feet 
And opens further on. 
He likes a boggy acre, 
A floor too cool for corn. 
Yet when a child, and barefoot, 
I more than once, at morn, 
Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash 
Unbraiding in the sun,-When, 
stooping to secure it, 
It wrinkled, and was gone. 
Several of nature's people 
I know, and they know me; 
I feel for them a transport 
Of cordiality; 
But never met this fellow, 
Attended or alone, 
Without a tighter breathing, 
And zero at the bone. 
A Nearness To Tremendousness 
 
A nearness to Tremendousness&mdash; 
An Agony procures&mdash; 
Affliction ranges Boundlessness&mdash; 
Vicinity to Laws 
Contentment's quiet Suburb&mdash; 
Affliction cannot stay 
In Acres&mdash;Its Location 
Is Illocality&mdash; 
A Night&Mdash;There Lay The Days Between 
 
A Night&mdash;there lay the Days between&mdash; 
The Day that was Before&mdash; 
And Day that was Behind&mdash;were one&mdash; 
And now&mdash;'twas Night&mdash;was here&mdash; 
Slow&mdash;Night&mdash;that must be watched away&mdash; 
As Grains upon a shore&mdash; 
Too imperceptible to note&mdash; 
Till it be night&mdash;no more&mdash; 
A Pang is more conspicuous in Spring 
A Pang is more conspicuous in Spring 
In contrast with the things that sing 
Not Birds entirely -but Minds Minute 
Effulgencies and Winds When 
what they sung for is undone 
Who cares about a Blue Bird's Tune Why, 
Resurrection had to wait 
Till they had moved a Stone 
A Planted Life&Mdash;Diversified 
 
A Planted Life&mdash;diversified 
With Gold and Silver Pain 
To prove the presence of the Ore 
In Particles&mdash;'tis when 
A Value struggle&mdash;it exist&mdash; 
A Power&mdash;will proclaim 
Although Annihilation pile 
Whole Chaoses on Him&mdash; 
A Poor&Mdash;Torn Heart&Mdash;A Tattered Heart 
 
A poor&mdash;torn heart&mdash;a tattered heart&mdash; 
That sat it down to rest&mdash; 
Nor noticed that the Ebbing Day 
Flowed silver to the West&mdash; 
Nor noticed Night did soft descend&mdash; 
Nor Constellation burn&mdash; 
Intent upon the vision 
Of latitudes unknown. 
The angels&mdash;happening that way 
This dusty heart espied&mdash; 
Tenderly took it up from toil 
And carried it to God&mdash; 
There&mdash;sandals for the Barefoot&mdash; 
There&mdash;gathered from the gales&mdash; 
Do the blue havens by the hand 
Lead the wandering Sails. 
A Precious—mouldering Pleasure 
 
A precious—mouldering pleasure—'tis— 
To meet an Antique Book— 
In just the Dress his Century wore— 
A privilege—I think— 
His venerable Hand to take— 
And warming in our own— 
A passage back—or two—to make— 
To Times when he—was young— 
His quaint opinions—to inspect— 
His thought to ascertain 
On Themes concern our mutual mind— 
The Literature of Man— 
What interested Scholars—most— 
What Competitions ran— 
When Plato—was a Certainty— 
And Sophocles—a Man— 
When Sappho—was a living Girl— 
And Beatrice wore 
The Gown that Dante—deified— 
Facts Centuries before 
He traverses—familiar— 
As One should come to Town— 
And tell you all your Dreams—were true— 
He lived—where Dreams were born— 
His presence is Enchantment— 
You beg him not to go— 
Old Volume shake their Vellum Heads 
And tantalize—just so— 
A Prison Gets To Be A Friend 
 
A Prison gets to be a friend&mdash; 
Between its Ponderous face 
And Ours&mdash;a Kinsmanship express&mdash; 
And in its narrow Eyes&mdash; 
We come to look with gratitude 
For the appointed Beam 
It deal us&mdash;stated as our food&mdash; 
And hungered for&mdash;the same&mdash; 
We learn to know the Planks&mdash; 
That answer to Our feet&mdash; 
So miserable a sound&mdash;at first&mdash; 
Nor ever now&mdash;so sweet&mdash; 
As plashing in the Pools&mdash; 
When Memory was a Boy&mdash; 
But a Demurer Circuit&mdash; 
A Geometric Joy&mdash; 
The Posture of the Key 
That interrupt the Day 
To Our Endeavor&mdash;Not so real 
The Check of Liberty&mdash; 
As this Phantasm Steel&mdash; 
Whose features&mdash;Day and Night&mdash; 
Are present to us&mdash;as Our Own&mdash; 
And as escapeless&mdash;quite&mdash; 
The narrow Round&mdash;the Stint&mdash; 
The slow exchange of Hope&mdash; 
For something passiver&mdash;Content 
Too steep for lookinp up&mdash; 
The Liberty we knew 
Avoided&mdash;like a Dream&mdash; 
Too wide for any Night but Heaven&mdash; 
If That&mdash;indeed&mdash;redeem&mdash; 
A Route Of Evanescence 
A Route of Evanescence 
With a revolving Wheel-A 
Resonance of Emerald-A 
Rush of Cochineal-And 
every Blossom on the Bush 
Adjusts its tumbled Head-The 
mail from Tunis, probably, 
An easy Morning's Ride-
A Science&Mdash;So The Savants Say 
 
A science&mdash;so the Savants say, 
"Comparative Anatomy"&mdash; 
By which a single bone&mdash; 
Is made a secret to unfold 
Of some rare tenant of the mold, 
Else perished in the stone&mdash; 
So to the eye prospective led, 
This meekest flower of the mead 
Upon a winter's day, 
Stands representative in gold 
Of Rose and Lily, manifold, 
And countless Butterfly! 
A Secret Told 
 
A Secret told&mdash; 
Ceases to be a Secret&mdash;then&mdash;

Better of it&mdash;continual be afraid&mdash; 
Than it&mdash; 
And Whom you told it to&mdash;beside&mdash; 
A Sepal, Petal, And A Thorn 
 
A sepal, petal, and a thorn 
Upon a common summer's morn&mdash; 
A flask of Dew&mdash;A Bee or two&mdash; 
A Breeze&mdash;a caper in the trees&mdash; 
And I'm a Rose! 
A Shade Upon The Mind There Passes 
 
A Shade upon the mind there passes 
As when on Noon 
A Cloud the mighty Sun encloses 
Remembering 
That some there be too numb to notice 
Oh God 
Why give if Thou must take away 
The Loved? 
A Shady Friend For Torrid Days 
A shady friend for torrid days 
Is easier to find 
Than one of higher temperature 
For frigid hour of mind. 
The vane a little to the east 
Scares muslin souls away; 
If broadcloth breasts are firmer 
Than those of organdy, 
Who is to blame? The weaver? 
Ah! the bewildering thread! 
The tapestries of paradise! 
So notelessly are made! 
A Sickness Of This World It Most Occasions 
A Sickness of this World it most occasions 
When Best Men die. 
A Wishfulness their far Condition 
To occupy. 
A Chief indifference, as Foreign 
A World must be 
Themselves forsake -contented, 
For Deity. 
A Single Screw Of Flesh 
 
Is all that pins the Soul 
That stands for Deity, to Mine, 
Upon my side the Veil&mdash; 
Once witnessed of the Gauze&mdash; 
Its name is put away 
As far from mine, as if no plight 
Had printed yesterday, 
In tender&mdash;solemn Alphabet, 
My eyes just turned to see, 
When it was smuggled by my sight 
Into Eternity&mdash; 
More Hands&mdash;to hold&mdash;These are but Two&mdash; 
One more new-mailed Nerve 
Just granted, for the Peril's sake&mdash; 
Some striding&mdash;Giant&mdash;Love&mdash; 
So greater than the Gods can show, 
They slink before the Clay, 
That not for all their Heaven can boast 
Will let its Keepsake&mdash;go 
A Slash Of Blue 
 
A slash of Blue&mdash; 
A sweep of Gray&mdash; 
Some scarlet patches on the way, 
Compose an Evening Sky&mdash; 
A little purple&mdash;slipped between&mdash; 
Some Ruby Trousers hurried on&mdash; 
A Wave of Gold&mdash; 
A Bank of Day&mdash; 
This just makes out the Morning Sky. 
A Sloop of Amber slips away 
A Sloop of Amber slips away 
Upon an Ether Sea, 
And wrecks in Peace a Purple Tar, 
The Son of Ecstasy 
A Solemn Thing Within The Soul 
 
A Solemn thing within the Soul 
To feel itself get ripe&mdash; 
And golden hang&mdash;while farther up&mdash; 
The Maker's Ladders stop&mdash; 
And in the Orchard far below&mdash; 
You hear a Being&mdash;drop&mdash; 
A Wonderful&mdash;to feel the Sun 
Still toiling at the Cheek 
You thought was finished&mdash; 
Cool of eye, and critical of Work&mdash; 
He shifts the stem&mdash;a little&mdash; 
To give your Core&mdash;a look&mdash; 
But solemnest&mdash;to know 
Your chance in Harvest moves 
A little nearer&mdash;Every Sun 
The Single&mdash;to some lives. 
A Solemn Thing&Mdash;It Was&Mdash;I Said 
 
A solemn thing&mdash;it was&mdash;I said&mdash; 
A woman&mdash;white&mdash;to be&mdash; 
And wear&mdash;if God should count me fit&mdash; 
Her blameless mystery&mdash; 
A hallowed thing&mdash;to drop a life 
Into the purple well&mdash; 
Too plummetless&mdash;that it return&mdash; 
Eternity&mdash;until&mdash; 
I pondered how the bliss would look&mdash; 
And would it feel as big&mdash; 
When I could take it in my hand&mdash; 
As hovering&mdash;seen&mdash;through fog&mdash; 
And then&mdash;the size of this "small" life&mdash; 
The Sages&mdash;call it small&mdash; 
Swelled&mdash;like Horizons&mdash;in my vest&mdash; 
And I sneered&mdash;softly&mdash;"small"! 
A Something In A Summer's Day 
 
A something in a summer's Day 
As slow her flambeaux burn away 
Which solemnizes me. 
A something in a summer's noon&mdash; 
A depth&mdash;an Azure&mdash;a perfume&mdash; 
Transcending ecstasy. 
And still within a summer's night 
A something so transporting bright 
I clap my hands to see&mdash; 
Then veil my too inspecting face 
Lets such a subtle&mdash;shimmering grace 
Flutter too far for me&mdash; 
The wizard fingers never rest&mdash; 
The purple brook within the breast 
Still chafes it narrow bed&mdash; 
Still rears the East her amber Flag&mdash; 
Guides still the sun along the Crag 
His Caravan of Red&mdash; 
So looking on&mdash;the night&mdash;the morn 
Conclude the wonder gay&mdash; 
And I meet, coming thro' the dews 
Another summer's Day! 
A South Wind&Mdash;Has A Pathos 
 
A South Wind&mdash;has a pathos 
Of individual Voice&mdash; 
As One detect on Landings 
An Emigrant's address. 
A Hint of Ports and Peoples&mdash; 
And much not understood&mdash; 
The fairer&mdash;for the farness&mdash; 
And for the foreignhood. 
A Spider sewed at Night 
A Spider sewed at Night 
Without a Light 
Upon an Arc of White. 
If Ruff it was of Dame 
Or Shroud of Gnome 
Himself himself inform. 
Of Immortality 
His Strategy 
Was Physiognomy. 
A Still—volcano—life 
 
A still—Volcano—Life— 
That flickered in the night— 
When it was dark enough to do 
Without erasing sight— 
A quiet—Earthquake Style— 
Too subtle to suspect 
By natures this side Naples— 
The North cannot detect 
The Solemn—Torrid—Symbol— 
The lips that never lie— 
Whose hissing Corals part—and shut— 
And Cities—ooze away— 
A Thought Went Up My Mind To-Day 
A thought went up my mind to-day 
That I have had before, 
But did not finish,--some way back, 
I could not fix the year, 
Nor where it went, nor why it came 
The second time to me, 
Nor definitely what it was, 
Have I the art to say. 
But somewhere in my soul, I know 
I've met the thing before; 
It just reminded me--'t was all-And 
came my way no more. 
A Throe Upon The Features 
 
A throe upon the features&mdash; 
A hurry in the breath&mdash; 
An ecstasy of parting 
Denominated "Death"&mdash; 
An anguish at the mention 
Which when to patience grown, 
I've known permission given 
To rejoin its own. 
A Toad Can Die Of Light! 
A toad can die of light!
 Death is the common right
 Of toads and men,-
Of earl and midge
 The privilege.
 Why swagger then?
 The gnat's supremacy
 Is large as thine. 
A Tongue—to Tell Him I Am True! 
 
A Tongue—to tell Him I am true! 
Its fee—to be of Gold— 
Had Nature—in Her monstrous House 
A single Ragged Child— 
To earn a Mine—would run 
That Interdicted Way, 
And tell Him—Charge thee speak it plain— 
That so far—Truth is True? 
And answer What I do— 
Beginning with the Day 
That Night—begun— 
Nay—Midnight—'twas— 
Since Midnight—happened—say— 
If once more—Pardon—Boy— 
The Magnitude thou may 
Enlarge my Message—If too vast 
Another Lad—help thee— 
Thy Pay—in Diamonds—be— 
And His—in solid Gold— 
Say Rubies—if He hesitate— 
My Message—must be told— 
Say—last I said—was This— 
That when the Hills—come down— 
And hold no higher than the Plain— 
My Bond—have just begun— 
And when the Heavens—disband— 
And Deity conclude— 
Then—look for me. Be sure you say— 
Least Figure—on the Road— 
A Tooth Upon Our Peace 
 
A Tooth upon Our Peace 
The Peace cannot deface&mdash; 
Then Wherefore be the Tooth? 
To vitalize the Grace&mdash; 
The Heaven hath a Hell&mdash; 
Itself to signalize&mdash; 
And every sign before the Place 
Is Gilt with Sacrifice&mdash; 
A train went through a burial gate 
A train went through a burial gate, 
A bird broke forth and sang, 
And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat 
Till all the churchyard rang; 
And then adjusted his little notes, 
And bowed and sang again. 
Doubtless, he thought it meet of him 
To say good-by to men. 
A Transport One Cannot Contain 
 
A transport one cannot contain 
May yet a transport be&mdash; 
Though God forbid it lift the lid&mdash; 
Unto its Ecstasy! 
A Diagram&mdash;of Rapture! 
A sixpence at a Show&mdash; 
With Holy Ghosts in Cages! 
The Universe would go! 
A Visitor In Marl 
 
A Visitor in Marl&mdash; 
Who influences Flowers&mdash; 
Till they are orderly as Busts&mdash; 
And Elegant&mdash;as Glass&mdash; 
Who visits in the Night&mdash; 
And just before the Sun&mdash; 
Concludes his glistening interview&mdash; 
Caresses&mdash;and is gone&mdash; 
But whom his fingers touched&mdash; 
And where his feet have run&mdash; 
And whatsoever Mouth be kissed&mdash; 
Is as it had not been&mdash; 
A Weight With Needles On The Pounds 
 
A Weight with Needles on the pounds&mdash; 
To push, and pierce, besides&mdash; 
That if the Flesh resist the Heft&mdash; 
The puncture&mdash;coolly tries&mdash; 
That not a pore be overlooked 
Of all this Compound Frame&mdash; 
As manifold for Anguish&mdash; 
As Species&mdash;be&mdash;for name&mdash; 
A Wife&Mdash;At Daybreak I Shall Be 
 
A Wife&mdash;at daybreak I shall be&mdash; 
Sunrise&mdash;Hast thou a Flag for me? 
At Midnight, I am but a Maid, 
How short it takes to make a Bride&mdash; 
Then&mdash;Midnight, I have passed from thee 
Unto the East, and Victory&mdash; 
Midnight&mdash;Good Night! I hear them call, 
The Angels bustle in the Hall&mdash; 
Softly my Future climbs the Stair, 
I fumble at my Childhood's prayer 
So soon to be a Child no more&mdash; 
Eternity, I'm coming&mdash;Sire, 
Savior&mdash;I've seen the face&mdash;before! 
A Wind That Rose 
A Wind that rose 
Though not a Leaf 
In any Forest stirred 
But with itself did cold engage 
Beyond the Realm of Bird A 
Wind that woke a lone Delight 
Like Separation's Swell 
Restored in Arctic Confidence 
To the Invisible 
A Word dropped careless on a Page 
A Word dropped careless on a Page 
May stimulate an eye 
When folded in perpetual seam 
The Wrinkled Maker lie 
Infection in the sentence breeds 
We may inhale Despair 
At distances of Centuries 
From the Malaria 
A Wounded Deer&Mdash;Leaps Highest 
 
A Wounded Deer&mdash;leaps highest&mdash; 
I've heard the Hunter tell&mdash; 
'Tis but the Ecstasy of death&mdash; 
And then the Brake is still! 
The Smitten Rock that gushes! 
The trampled Steel that springs! 
A Cheek is always redder 
Just where the Hectic stings! 
Mirth is the Mail of Anguish 
In which it Cautious Arm, 
Lest anybody spy the blood 
And "you're hurt" exclaim! 
Abraham To Kill Him 
Abraham to kill him 
Was distinctly told— 
Isaac was an Urchin— 
Abraham was old— 
Not a hesitation— 
Abraham complied— 
Flattered by Obeisance 
Tyranny demurred— 
Isaac—to his children 
Lived to tell the tale— 
Moral—with a mastiff 
Manners may prevail. 
Absence Disembodies—so Does Death 
 
Absence disembodies—so does Death 
Hiding individuals from the Earth 
Superposition helps, as well as love— 
Tenderness decreases as we prove— 
Absent Place&Mdash;An April Day 
 
Absent Place&mdash;an April Day&mdash; 
Daffodils a-blow 
Homesick curiosity 
To the Souls that snow&mdash; 
Drift may block within it 
Deeper than without&mdash; 
Daffodil delight but 
Him it duplicate&mdash; 
Adrift! A Little Boat Adrift! 
 
Adrift! A little boat adrift! 
And night is coming down! 
Will no one guide a little boat 
Unto the nearest town? 
So Sailors say&mdash;on yesterday&mdash; 
Just as the dusk was brown 
One little boat gave up its strife 
And gurgled down and down. 
So angels say&mdash;on yesterday&mdash; 
Just as the dawn was red 
One little boat&mdash;o'erspent with gales&mdash; 
Retrimmed its masts&mdash;redecked its sails&mdash; 
And shot&mdash;exultant on! 
Afraid! Of Whom Am I Afraid? 
 
Afraid! Of whom am I afraid? 
Not Death&mdash;for who is He? 
The Porter of my Father's Lodge 
As much abasheth me! 
Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear [a] thing 
That comprehendeth me 
In one or two existences&mdash; 
As Deity decree&mdash; 
Of Resurrection? Is the East 
Afraid to trust the Morn 
With her fastidious forehead? 
As soon impeach my Crown! 
After A Hundred Years 
After a hundred years 
Nobody knows the place,-Agony, 
that enacted there, 
Motionless as peace. 
Weeds triumphant ranged, 
Strangers strolled and spelled 
At the lone orthography 
Of the elder dead. 
Winds of summer fields 
Recollect the way,-Instinct 
picking up the key 
Dropped by memory. 
After Great Pain, A Formal Feeling Comes 
After great pain, a formal feeling comes-The 
Nerves sit ceremonious, like Toombs-The 
stiff Heart questions was it He, that bore, 
And Yesterday, or Centuries before? 
The Feet, mechanical, go round-Of 
Ground, or Air, or Ought-A 
Wooden way 
Regardless grown, 
A Quartz contentment, like a stone-
This is the Hour of Lead-Remembered, 
if outlived, 
As Freezing persons recollect the Snow-First--
Chill--then Stupor--then the letting go-
Again&Mdash;His Voice Is At The Door 
 
Again&mdash;his voice is at the door&mdash; 
I feel the old Degree&mdash; 
I hear him ask the servant 
For such an one&mdash;as me&mdash; 
I take a flower&mdash;as I go&mdash; 
My face to justify&mdash; 
He never saw me&mdash;in this life&mdash; 
I might surprise his eye! 
I cross the Hall with mingled steps&mdash; 
I&mdash;silent&mdash;pass the door&mdash; 
I look on all this world contains&mdash; 
Just his face&mdash;nothing more! 
We talk in careless&mdash;and it toss&mdash; 
A kind of plummet strain&mdash; 
Each&mdash;sounding&mdash;shyly&mdash; 
Just&mdash;how&mdash;deep&mdash; 
The other's one&mdash;had been&mdash; 
We walk&mdash;I leave my Dog&mdash;at home&mdash; 
A tender&mdash;thoughtful Moon&mdash; 
Goes with us&mdash;just a little way&mdash; 
And&mdash;then&mdash;we are alone&mdash; 
Alone&mdash;if Angels are "alone"&mdash; 
First time they try the sky! 
Alone&mdash;if those "veiled faces"&mdash;be&mdash; 
We cannot count&mdash;on High! 
I'd give&mdash;to live that hour&mdash;again&mdash; 
The purple&mdash;in my Vein&mdash; 
But He must count the drops&mdash;himself&mdash; 
My price for every stain! 
Ah, Moon—and Star! 
 
Ah, Moon—and Star! 
You are very far— 
But were no one 
Farther than you— 
Do you think I'd stop 
For a Firmament— 
Or a Cubit—or so? 
I could borrow a Bonnet 
Of the Lark— 
And a Chamois' Silver Boot— 
And a stirrup of an Antelope— 
And be with you—Tonight! 
But, Moon, and Star, 
Though you're very far— 
There is one—farther than you— 
He—is more than a firmament—from Me— 
So I can never go! 
Ah, Teneriffe! 
 
Ah, Teneriffe! 
Retreating Mountain! 
Purples of Ages&mdash;pause for you&mdash;

Still&mdash;Clad in your Mail of ices&mdash; 
Thigh of Granite&mdash;and thew&mdash;of Steel&mdash; 
Heedless&mdash;alike&mdash;of pomp&mdash;or parting 
Ah, Teneriffe! 
I'm kneeling&mdash;still&mdash; 
Air has no Residence, no Neighbor 
Air has no Residence, no Neighbor, 
No Ear, no Door, 
No Apprehension of Another 
Oh, Happy Air!

Term of Light this Day begun! 
Failless as the fair rotation

Yet upon His Purple Programme 
Every Dawn, is first. 
Ambition Cannot Find Him

Affection doesn't know

Ample Make This Bed. 
Ample make this bed. 
Make this bed with awe; 
In it wait till judgment break 
Excellent and fair.

Interrupt this ground. 
An Altered Look About The Hills 
 
An altered look about the hills&mdash; 
A Tyrian light the village fills&mdash; 
A wider sunrise in the morn&mdash; 
A deeper twilight on the lawn&mdash; 
A print of a vermillion foot&mdash; 
A purple finger on the slope&mdash; 
A flippant fly upon the pane&mdash; 
A spider at his trade again&mdash; 
An added strut in Chanticleer&mdash; 
A flower expected everywhere&mdash; 
An axe shrill singing in the woods&mdash; 
Fern odors on untravelled roads&mdash; 
All this and more I cannot tell&mdash; 
A furtive look you know as well&mdash; 
And Nicodemus' Mystery 
Receives its annual reply! 
An Antiquated Tree 
An Antiquated Tree 
Is cherished of the Crow 
Because that Junior Foliage is disrespectful now 
To venerable Birds

An Awful Tempest Mashed The Air 
 
An awful Tempest mashed the air&mdash; 
The clouds were gaunt, and few&mdash; 
A Black&mdash;as of a Spectre's Cloak 
Hid Heaven and Earth from view. 
The creatures chuckled on the Roofs&mdash; 
And whistled in the air&mdash; 
And shook their fists&mdash; 
And gnashed their teeth&mdash; 
And swung their frenzied hair. 
The morning lit&mdash;the Birds arose&mdash; 
The Monster's faded eyes 
Turned slowly to his native coast&mdash; 
And peace&mdash;was Paradise! 
An English Breeze 
UP with the sun, the breeze arose, 
Across the talking corn she goes, 
And smooth she rustles far and wide 
Through all the voiceful countryside. 
Through all the land her tale she tells; 
She spins, she tosses, she compels 
The kites, the clouds, the windmill sails 
And all the trees in all the dales. 
God calls us, and the day prepares 
With nimble, gay and gracious airs: 
And from Penzance to Maidenhead 
The roads last night He watered. 
God calls us from inglorious ease, 
Forth and to travel with the breeze 
While, swift and singing, smooth and strong 
She gallops by the fields along. 
An Everywhere Of Silver 
An everywhere of silver, 
With ropes of sand 
To keep it from effacing 
The track called land.

And This Of All My Hopes 
 
And this of all my Hopes 
This, is the silent end 
Bountiful colored, my Morning rose 
Early and sere, its end 
Never Bud from a Stem 
Stepped with so gay a Foot 
Never a Worm so confident 
Bored at so brave a Root 
And with what body do they come 
'And with what body do they come?' Then 
they do come -Rejoice! 
What Door -What Hour -Run -run -My Soul! 
Illuminate the House! 
'Body!' Then real -a Face and Eyes To 
know that it is them!

For an approving God. 
Arcturus 
"Arcturus" is his other name— 
I'd rather call him "Star." 
It's very mean of Science 
To go and interfere! 
I slew a worm the other day— 
A "Savant" passing by 
Murmured "Resurgam"—"Centipede"! 
"Oh Lord—how frail are we"! 
I pull a flower from the woods— 
A monster with a glass 
Computes the stamens in a breath— 
And has her in a "class"! 
Whereas I took the Butterfly 
Aforetime in my hat— 
He sits erect in "Cabinets"— 
The Clover bells forgot. 
What once was "Heaven" 
Is "Zenith" now— 
Where I proposed to go 
When Time's brief masquerade was done 
Is mapped and charted too. 
What if the poles should frisk about 
And stand upon their heads! 
I hope I'm ready for "the worst"— 
Whatever prank betides! 
Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed— 
I hope the "Children" there Won't be "new fashioned" when I come— 
And laugh at me—and stare— 
I hope the Father in the skies 
Will lift his little girl— 
Old fashioned—naught—everything— 
Over the stile of "Pearl." 
'Arcturus' Is His Other Name 
 
'Arcturus' is his other name— 
I'd rather call him 'Star.' 
It's very mean of Science 
To go and interfere! 
I slew a worm the other day— 
A 'Savant' passing by 
Murmured 'Resurgam'—'Centipede'! 
'Oh Lord—how frail are we'!

A monster with a glass

Are Friends Delight Or Pain 
Are Friends Delight or Pain? 
Could Bounty but remain 
Riches were good 
But if they only stay 
Ampler to fly away 
Riches are sad. 
Artists Wrestled Here! 
 
Artists wrestled here! 
Lo, a tint Cashmere! 
Lo, a Rose! 
Student of the Year! 
For the easel here 
Say Repose! 
As By The Dead We Love To Sit 
 
As by the dead we love to sit, 
Become so wondrous dear&mdash; 
As for the lost we grapple 
Tho' all the rest are here&mdash; 
In broken mathematics 
We estimate our prize 
Vast&mdash;in its fading ration 
To our penurious eyes! 
As Children Bid The Guest "Good Night" 
 
As Children bid the Guest "Good Night" 
And then reluctant turn&mdash; 
My flowers raise their pretty lips&mdash; 
Then put their nightgowns on. 
As children caper when they wake 
Merry that it is Morn&mdash; 
My flowers from a hundred cribs 
Will peep, and prance again. 
As Everywhere Of Silver 
 
As Everywhere of Silver 
With Ropes of Sand 
To keep it from effacing 
The Track called Land. 
As Far From Pity, As Complaint 
 
As far from pity, as complaint&mdash; 
As cool to speech&mdash;as stone&mdash; 
As numb to Revelation 
As if my Trade were Bone&mdash; 
As far from time&mdash;as History&mdash; 
As near yourself&mdash;Today&mdash; 
As Children, to the Rainbow's scarf&mdash; 
Or Sunset's Yellow play 
To eyelids in the Sepulchre&mdash; 
How dumb the Dancer lies&mdash; 
While Color's Revelations break&mdash; 
And blaze&mdash;the Butterflies! 
As from the earth the light Balloon 
As from the earth the light Balloon 
Asks nothing but release Ascension 
that for which it was, 
Its soaring Residence. 
The spirit looks upon the Dust 
That fastened it so long 
With indignation, 
As a Bird 
Defrauded of its song. 
As Frost Is Best Conceived 
 
As Frost is best conceived 
By force of its Result&mdash; 
Affliction is inferred 
By subsequent effect&mdash; 
If when the sun reveal, 
The Garden keep the Gash&mdash; 
If as the Days resume 
The wilted countenance 
Cannot correct the crease 
Or counteract the stain&mdash; 
Presumption is Vitality 
Was somewhere put in twain. 
As If I Asked A Common Alms 
 
As if I asked a common Alms, 
And in my wondering hand 
A Stranger pressed a Kingdom, 
And I, bewildered, stand&mdash; 
As if I asked the Orient 
Had it for me a Morn&mdash; 
And it should lift its purple Dikes, 
And shatter me with Dawn! 
As If Some Little Arctic Flower 
 
As if some little Arctic flower 
Upon the polar hem&mdash; 
Went wandering down the Latitudes 
Until it puzzled came 
To continents of summer&mdash; 
To firmaments of sun&mdash; 
To strange, bright crowds of flowers&mdash; 
And birds, of foreign tongue! 
I say, As if this little flower 
To Eden, wandered in&mdash; 
What then? Why nothing, 
Only, your inference therefrom! 
As If The Sea Should Part 
 
As if the Sea should part 
And show a further Sea&mdash; 
And that&mdash;a further&mdash;and the Three 
But a presumption be&mdash; 
Of Periods of Seas&mdash; 
Unvisited of Shores&mdash; 
Themselves the Verge of Seas to be&mdash; 
Eternity&mdash;is Those&mdash; 
As Imperceptibly As Grief 
 
As imperceptibly as Grief 
The Summer lapsed away&mdash; 
Too imperceptible at last 
To seem like Perfidy&mdash; 
A Quietness distilled 
As Twilight long begun, 
Or Nature spending with herself 
Sequestered Afternoon&mdash; 
The Dusk drew earlier in&mdash; 
The Morning foreign shone&mdash; 
A courteous, yet harrowing Grace, 
As Guest, that would be gone&mdash; 
And thus, without a Wing 
Or service of a Keel 
Our Summer made her light escape 
Into the Beautiful. 
As old as Woe 
As old as Woe How 
old is that? 
Some eighteen thousand years As 
old as Bliss 
How old is that 
They are of equal years 
Together chiefest they ard found 
But seldom side by side 
From neither of them tho' he try 
Can Human nature hide 
As One Does Sickness Over 
 
As One does Sickness over 
In convalescent Mind, 
His scrutiny of Chances 
By blessed Health obscured&mdash; 
As One rewalks a Precipice 
And whittles at the Twig 
That held Him from Perdition 
Sown sidewise in the Crag 
A Custom of the Soul 
Far after suffering 
Identity to question 
For evidence't has been&mdash; 
As Plan For Noon And Plan For Night 
 
As plan for Noon and plan for Night 
So differ Life and Death 
In positive Prospective&mdash; 
The Foot upon the Earth 
At Distance, and Achievement, strains, 
The Foot upon the Grave 
Makes effort at conclusion 
Assisted faint of Love. 
As Sleigh Bells Seem In Summer 
 
As Sleigh Bells seem in summer 
Or Bees, at Christmas show&mdash; 
So fairy&mdash;so fictitious 
The individuals do 
Repealed from observation&mdash; 
A Party that we knew&mdash; 
More distant in an instant 
Than Dawn in Timbuctoo. 
As subtle as tomorrow 
As subtle as tomorrow 
That never came, 
A warrant, a conviction, 
Yet but a name. 
As The Starved Maelstrom Laps The Navies 
 
As the Starved Maelstrom laps the Navies 
As the Vulture teased 
Forces the Broods in lonely Valleys 
As the Tiger eased 
By but a Crumb of Blood, fasts Scarlet 
Till he meet a Man 
Dainty adorned with Veins and Tissues 
And partakes&mdash;his Tongue 
Cooled by the Morsel for a moment 
Grows a fiercer thing 
Till he esteem his Dates and Cocoa 
A Nutrition mean 
I, of a finer Famine 
Deem my Supper dry 
For but a Berry of Domingo 
And a Torrid Eye. 
As Watchers Hang Upon The East 
 
As Watchers hang upon the East, 
As Beggars revel at a feast 
By savory Fancy spread&mdash; 
As brooks in deserts babble sweet 
On ear too far for the delight, 
Heaven beguiles the tired. 
As that same watcher, when the East 
Opens the lid of Amethyst 
And lets the morning go&mdash; 
That Beggar, when an honored Guest, 
Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed, 
Heaven to us, if true. 
At Last, To Be Identified! 
 
At last, to be identified! 
At last, the lamps upon thy side 
The rest of Life to see! 
Past Midnight! Past the Morning Star! 
Past Sunrise! 
Ah, What leagues there were 
Between our feet, and Day! 
At Least—to Pray—is Left—is Left 
 
At least—to pray—is left—is left— 
Oh Jesus—in the Air— 
I know not which thy chamber is— 
I'm knocking—everywhere— 
Thou settest Earthquake in the South— 
And Maelstrom, in the Sea— 
Say, Jesus Christ of Nazareth— 
Hast thou no Arm for Me? 
Autumn&Mdash;Overlooked My Knitting 
 
Autumn&mdash;overlooked my Knitting&mdash; 
Dyes&mdash;said He&mdash;have I&mdash; 
Could disparage a Flamingo&mdash; 
Show Me them&mdash;said I&mdash; 
Cochineal&mdash;I chose&mdash;for deeming 
It resemble Thee&mdash; 
And the little Border&mdash;Dusker&mdash; 
For resembling Me&mdash; 
Awake Ye Muses Nine, Sing Me A Strain Divine 
 
Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine, 
Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine! 
Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain, 
For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain. 
All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air, 
God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair! 
The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one, 
Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun; 
The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be, 
Who will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree. 
The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small, 
None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball; 
The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives, 
And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves; 
The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won, 
And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son. 
The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune, 
The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon, 
Their spirits meet together, they make their solemn vows, 
No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose. 
The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride, 
Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide; 
Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true, 
And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue. 
Now to the application, to the reading of the roll, 
To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul: 
Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone, 
Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown. 
Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long, 
And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song? 
There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair, 
And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair! 
Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see 
Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree; 
Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb, 
And seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time! 
Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower, 
And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower&mdash; 
And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum&mdash; 
And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home! 
Away From Home Are Some And I— 
 
Away from Home are some and I— 
An Emigrant to be 
In a Metropolis of Homes 
Is easy, possibly— 
The Habit of a Foreign Sky 
We—difficult—acquire 
As Children, who remain in Face 
The more their Feet retire. 
Baffled For Just A Day Or Two 
 
Baffled for just a day or two&mdash; 
Embarrassed&mdash;not afraid&mdash; 
Encounter in my garden 
An unexpected Maid. 
She beckons, and the woods start&mdash; 
She nods, and all begin&mdash; 
Surely, such a country 
I was never in! 
Banish Air From Air&Mdash; 
 
Banish Air from Air&mdash; 
Divide Light if you dare&mdash; 
They'll meet 
While Cubes in a Drop 
Or Pellets of Shape 
Fit 
Films cannot annul 
Odors return whole 
Force Flame 
And with a Blonde push 
Over your impotence 
Flits Steam. 
Be Mine The Doom&Mdash; 
 
Be Mine the Doom&mdash; 
Sufficient Fame&mdash; 
To perish in Her Hand! 
Beauty&Mdash;Be Not Caused&Mdash;It Is 
 
Beauty&mdash;be not caused&mdash;It Is&mdash; 
Chase it, and it ceases&mdash; 
Chase it not, and it abides&mdash; 
Overtake the Creases 
In the Meadow&mdash;when the Wind 
Runs his fingers thro' it&mdash; 
Deity will see to it 
That You never do it&mdash; 
Because I Could Not Stop For Death 
Because I could not stop for Death-
He kindly stopped for me-
The Carriage held but just Ourselves-
And Immortality. 
We slowly drove- He knew no haste 
And I had put away 
My labor and my leisure too, 
For His Civility-
We passed the School, where Children strove 
At Recess- in the Ring-
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain-
We passed the Setting Sun-
Or rather- He passed us-
The Dews drew quivering and chill-
For only Gossamer, my Gown-
My Tippet- only Tulle-
We paused before a House that seemed 
A Swelling of the Ground-
The Roof was scarcely visible-
The Cornice- in the Ground-
Since then- 'tis Centuries- and yet 
Feels shorter than the Day 
I first surmised the Horses' Heads 
Were toward Eternity-
Because The Bee May Blameless Hum 
 
Because the Bee may blameless hum 
For Thee a Bee do I become 
List even unto Me. 
Because the Flowers unafraid 
May lift a look on thine, a Maid 
Alway a Flower would be. 
Nor Robins, Robins need not hide 
When Thou upon their Crypts intrude 
So Wings bestow on Me 
Or Petals, or a Dower of Buzz 
That Bee to ride, or Flower of Furze 
I that way worship Thee. 
Beclouded 
The sky is low, the clouds are mean, 
A travelling flake of snow 
Across a barn or through a rut 
Debates if it will go. 
A narrow wind complains all day 
How some one treated him; 
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught 
Without her diadem. 
Bee! I'M Expecting You! 
 
Bee! I'm expecting you! 
Was saying Yesterday 
To Somebody you know 
That you were due&mdash; 
The Frogs got Home last Week&mdash; 
Are settled, and at work&mdash; 
Birds, mostly back&mdash; 
The Clover warm and thick&mdash; 
You'll get my Letter by 
The seventeenth; Reply 
Or better, be with me&mdash; 
Yours, Fly. 
Before He Comes We Weigh The Time! 
 
Before He comes we weigh the Time! 
'Tis Heavy and 'tis Light. 
When He depart, an Emptiness 
Is the prevailing Freight. 
Before I Got My Eye Put Out 
 
Before I got my eye put out 
I liked as well to see&mdash; 
As other Creatures, that have Eyes 
And know no other way&mdash; 
But were it told to me&mdash;Today&mdash; 
That I might have the sky 
For mine&mdash;I tell you that my Heart 
Would split, for size of me&mdash; 
The Meadows&mdash;mine&mdash; 
The Mountains&mdash;mine&mdash; 
All Forests&mdash;Stintless Stars&mdash; 
As much of Noon as I could take 
Between my finite eyes&mdash; 
The Motions of the Dipping Birds&mdash; 
The Morning's Amber Road&mdash; 
For mine&mdash;to look at when I liked&mdash; 
The News would strike me dead&mdash; 
So safer&mdash;guess&mdash;with just my soul 
Upon the Window pane&mdash; 
Where other Creatures put their eyes&mdash; 
Incautious&mdash;of the Sun&mdash; 
Before The Ice Is In The Pools 
 
Before the ice is in the pools&mdash; 
Before the skaters go, 
Or any check at nightfall 
Is tarnished by the snow&mdash; 
Before the fields have finished, 
Before the Christmas tree, 
Wonder upon wonder 
Will arrive to me! 
What we touch the hems of 
On a summer's day&mdash; 
What is only walking 
Just a bridge away&mdash; 
That which sings so&mdash;speaks so&mdash; 
When there's no one here&mdash; 
Will the frock I wept in 
Answer me to wear? 
Before You Thought Of Spring, 
Before you thought of spring, 
Except as a surmise, 
You see, God bless his suddenness, 
A fellow in the skies 
Of independent hues, 
A little weather-worn, 
Inspiriting habiliments 
Of indigo and brown. 
With specimens of song, 
As if for you to choose, 
Discretion in the interval, 
With gay delays he goes 
To some superior tree 
Without a single leaf, 
And shouts for joy to nobody 
But his seraphic self! 
Behind Me Dips Eternity 
 
Behind Me—dips Eternity— 
Before Me—Immortality— 
Myself—the Term between— 
Death but the Drift of Eastern Gray, 
Dissolving into Dawn away, 
Before the West begin— 
'Tis Kingdoms—afterward—they say— 
In perfect—pauseless Monarchy— 
Whose Prince—is Son of None— 
Himself—His Dateless Dynasty— 
Himself—Himself diversify— 
In Duplicate divine— 
'Tis Miracle before Me—then— 
'Tis Miracle behind—between— 
A Crescent in the Sea— 
With Midnight to the North of Her— 
And Midnight to the South of Her— 
And Maelstrom—in the Sky— 
Bereaved Of All, I Went Abroad 
 
Bereaved of all, I went abroad&mdash; 
No less bereaved was I 
Upon a New Peninsula&mdash; 
The Grave preceded me&mdash; 
Obtained my Lodgings, ere myself&mdash; 
And when I sought my Bed&mdash; 
The Grave it was reposed upon 
The Pillow for my Head&mdash; 
I waked to find it first awake&mdash; 
I rose&mdash;It followed me&mdash; 
I tried to drop it in the Crowd&mdash; 
To lose it in the Sea&mdash; 
In Cups of artificial Drowse 
To steep its shape away&mdash; 
The Grave&mdash;was finished&mdash;but the Spade 
Remained in Memory&mdash; 
Bereavement In Their Death To Feel 
 
Bereavement in their death to feel 
Whom We have never seen&mdash; 
A Vital Kinsmanship import 
Our Soul and theirs&mdash;between&mdash; 
For Stranger&mdash;Strangers do not mourn&mdash; 
There be Immortal friends 
Whom Death see first&mdash;'tis news of this 
That paralyze Ourselves&mdash; 
Who, vital only to Our Thought&mdash; 
Such Presence bear away 
In dying&mdash;'tis as if Our Souls 
Absconded&mdash;suddenly&mdash; 
Besides The Autumn Poets Sing 
 
Besides the Autumn poets sing 
A few prosaic days 
A little this side of the snow

A few incisive Mornings&mdash; 
A few Ascetic Eves&mdash; 
Gone&mdash;Mr. Bryant's "Golden Rod"&mdash; 
And Mr. Thomson's "sheaves." 
Still, is the bustle in the Brook&mdash; 
Sealed are the spicy valves&mdash; 
Mesmeric fingers softly touch 
The Eyes of many Elves&mdash;

My sentiments to share&mdash; 
Grant me, Oh Lord, a sunny mind&mdash; 
Thy windy will to bear!

Besides this May 
We know 
There is Another&mdash;

Our Speculations of the Foreigner!

Where Saints, and our plain going Neighbor 
Keep May!

Better—than Music! For I—who Heard It 
 
Better—than Music! For I—who heard it— 
I was used—to the Birds—before— 
This—was different—'Twas Translation— 
Of all tunes I knew—and more— 
'Twasn't contained—like other stanza— 
No one could play it—the second time— 
But the Composer—perfect Mozart— 
Perish with him—that Keyless Rhyme! 
So—Children—told how Brooks in Eden— 
Bubbled a better—Melody—

Urging the feet—that would—not—fly— 
Children—matured—are wiser—mostly— 
Eden—a legend—dimly told— 
Eve—and the Anguish—Grandame's story— 
But—I was telling a tune—I heard— 
Not such a strain—the Church—baptizes— 
When the last Saint—goes up the Aisles— 
Not such a stanza splits the silence— 
When the Redemption strikes her Bells— 
Let me not spill—its smallest cadence— 
Humming—for promise—when alone— 
Humming—until my faint Rehearsal— 
Drop into tune—around the Throne— 
Between My Country—and The Others 
Between My Country—and the Others— 
There is a Sea— 
But Flowers—negotiate between us— 
As Ministry. 
Bird 
A bird came down the walk: 
He did not know I saw; 
He bit an angle-worm in halves 
And ate the fellow, raw. 
And then he drank a dew 
From a convenient grass, 
And the hopped sideways to the wall 
To let a beetle pass. 
He glanced with rapid eyes 
That hurried all abroad, They 
looked like frightened beads, I thought 
He stirred his velvet head. 
Like one in danger; cautious, 
I offered him a crumb, 
And he unrolled his feathers 
And rolled him softer home 
Then oars divide the ocean, 
Too silver for a seam, 
Or butterflies, off banks of noon, 
Leap, plashless, as they swim. 
Blazing In Gold And Quenching In Purple 
 
Blazing in Gold and quenching in Purple 
Leaping like Leopards to the Sky 
Then at the feet of the old Horizon 
Laying her spotted Face to die 
Stooping as low as the Otter's Window 
Touching the Roof and tinting the Barn 
Kissing her Bonnet to the Meadow 
And the Juggler of Day is gone 
Bless God, He Went As Soldiers 
 
Bless God, he went as soldiers, 
His musket on his breast&mdash; 
Grant God, he charge the bravest 
Of all the martial blest! 
Please God, might I behold him 
In epauletted white&mdash; 
I should not fear the foe then&mdash; 
I should not fear the fight! 
Bloom Upon The Mountain—stated 
 
Bloom upon the Mountain—stated— 
Blameless of a Name— 
Efflorescence of a Sunset— 
Reproduced—the same— 
Seed, had I, my Purple Sowing 
Should endow the Day— 
Not a Topic of a Twilight— 
Show itself away— 
Who for tilling—to the Mountain 
Come, and disappear— 
Whose be Her Renown, or fading, 
Witness, is not here— 
While I state—the Solemn Petals,

As with Algebra! 
Tell it the Ages&mdash;to a cypher&mdash;

Notching the fall of the Even Sun! 
Bring Me The Sunset In A Cup 
 
Bring me the sunset in a cup, 
Reckon the morning's flagons up 
And say how many Dew, 
Tell me how far the morning leaps&mdash; 
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps 
Who spun the breadth of blue! 
Write me how many notes there be 
In the new Robin's ecstasy 
Among astonished boughs&mdash; 
How many trips the Tortoise makes&mdash; 
How many cups the Bee partakes, 
The Debauchee of Dews! 
Also, who laid the Rainbow's piers, 
Also, who leads the docile spheres 
By withes of supple blue? 
Whose fingers string the stalactite&mdash; 
Who counts the wampum of the night 
To see that none is due? 
Who built this little Alban House 
And shut the windows down so close 
My spirit cannot see? 
Who'll let me out some gala day 
With implements to fly away, 
Passing Pomposity? 
But Little Carmine Hath Her Face 
 
But little Carmine hath her face&mdash;

By A Flower—by A Letter 
 
By a flower—By a letter— 
By a nimble love— 
If I weld the Rivet faster— 
Final fast—above— 
Never mind my breathless Anvil! 
Never mind Repose! 
Never mind the sooty faces 
Tugging at the Forge!

They&mdash;suggest to our Sight&mdash; 
When the latter&mdash;is put away 
I shall meet with Conviction I somewhere met 
That Immortality&mdash; 
Was the Pine at my Window a "Fellow 
Of the Royal" Infinity? 
Apprehensions&mdash;are God's introductions&mdash; 
To be hallowed&mdash;accordingly&mdash; 
By Such And Such An Offering 
 
By such and such an offering 
To Mr. So and So, 
The web of live woven&mdash; 
So martyrs albums show! 
By The Sea 
I started early, took my dog, 
And visited the sea; 
The mermaids in the basement 
Came out to look at me. 
And frigates in the upper floor 
Extended hempen hands, 
Presuming me to be a mouse 
Aground, upon the sands. 
But no man moved me till the tide 
Went past my simple shoe, 
And past my apron and my belt, 
And past my bodice too, 
And made as he would eat me up 
As wholly as a dew 
Upon a dandelion's sleeve And 
then I started too. 
And he - he followed close behind; 
I felt his silver heel 
Upon my ankle, - then my shoes 
Would overflow with pearl. 
Until we met the solid town, 
No man he seemed to know; 
And bowing with a mighty look 
At me, the sea withdrew. 
Chartless 
I never saw a moor, 
I never saw the sea; 
Yet now I know how the heather looks, 
And what a wave must be. 
I never spoke with God, 
Nor visited in Heaven; 
Yet certain am I of the spot 
As if the chart were given. 
Civilization&Mdash;Spurns&Mdash;The Leopard! 
 
Civilization&mdash;spurns&mdash;the Leopard! 
Was the Leopard&mdash;bold? 
Deserts&mdash;never rebuked her Satin&mdash; 
Ethiop&mdash;her Gold&mdash; 
Tawny&mdash;her Customs&mdash; 
She was Conscious&mdash; 
Spotted&mdash;her Dun Gown&mdash; 
This was the Leopard's nature&mdash;Signor&mdash; 
Need&mdash;a keeper&mdash;frown? 
Pity&mdash;the Pard&mdash;that left her Asia&mdash; 
Memories&mdash;of Palm&mdash; 
Cannot be stifled&mdash;with Narcotic&mdash; 
Nor suppressed&mdash;with Balm&mdash; 
Cocoon Above! Cocoon Below! 
 
Cocoon above! Cocoon below! 
Stealthy Cocoon, why hide you so 
What all the world suspect? 
An hour, and gay on every tree 
Your secret, perched in ecstasy 
Defies imprisonment! 
An hour in Chrysalis to pass, 
Then gay above receding grass 
A Butterfly to go! 
A moment to interrogate, 
Then wiser than a "Surrogate," 
The Universe to know! 
Color—caste—denomination 
 
Color—Caste—Denomination— 
These—are Time's Affair— 
Death's diviner Classifying 
Does not know they are— 
As in sleep—All Hue forgotten— 
Tenets—put behind— 
Death's large—Democratic fingers 
Rub away the Brand— 
If Circassian—He is careless— 
If He put away 
Chrysalis of Blonde—or Umber— 
Equal Butterfly— 
They emerge from His Obscuring— 
What Death—knows so well— 
Our minuter intuitions— 
Deem unplausible— 
Come Slowly 
Come slowly, 
Eden 
Lips unused to thee. 
Bashful, sip thy jasmines, 
As the fainting bee, 
Reaching late his flower, 
Round her chamber hums, 
Counts his nectars -alights, 
And is lost in balms!

Could I but ride indefinite 
As doth the Meadow Bee 
And visit only where I liked 
And No one visit me 
And flirt all Day with Buttercups 
And marry whom I may 
And dwell a little everywhere 
Or better, run away 
With no Police to follow 
Or chase Him if He do 
Till He should jump Peninsulas 
To get away from me&mdash; 
I said "But just to be a Bee" 
Upon a Raft of Air 
And row in Nowhere all Day long 
And anchor "off the Bar" 
What Liberty! So Captives deem 
Who tight in Dungeons are.

Lest my beseeching face—at last—

Could smile upon the whole 
Through faith in one he met not, 
To introduce his soul. 
Could go from scene familiar 
To an untraversed spot— 
Could contemplate the journey 
With unpuzzled heart— 
Such trust had one among us, 
Among us not today— 
We who saw the launching 
Never sailed the Bay!

Crisis Is A Hair 
 
Crisis is a Hair 
Toward which the forces creep 
Past which forces retrograde 
If it come in sleep 
To suspend the Breath

Ignorant is it Life or Death 
Nicely balancing.

That secures Eternity

Crumbling is not an instant's Act

But when the vivid Ore 
Has vanquished Flame's conditions, 
It quivers from the Forge 
Without a color, but the light

Stands symbol for the finer Forge

Dear March - Come in 
DEAR March, come in!	 
How glad I am!	 
I looked for you before.	 
Put down your hat—	 
You must have walked—	
How out of breath you are!	 
Dear March, how are you?	 
And the rest?	 
Did you leave Nature well?	 
Oh, March, come right upstairs with me,	
I have so much to tell!	 
I got your letter, and the bird's;	 
The maples never knew	 
That you were coming,—I declare,	 
How red their faces grew!	
But, March, forgive me—	 
And all those hills	 
You left for me to hue;	 
There was no purple suitable,	 
You took it all with you.	
Who knocks? That April!	 
Lock the door!	 
I will not be pursued!	 
He stayed away a year, to call	 
When I am occupied.	
But trifles look so trivial	 
As soon as you have come,	 
That blame is just as dear as praise	 
And praise as mere as blame.	 
Death Is A Dialogue Between 
 
Death is a Dialogue between 
The Spirit and the Dust. 
"Dissolve" says Death&mdash;The Spirit "Sir 
I have another Trust"&mdash; 
Death doubts it&mdash;Argues from the Ground&mdash; 
The Spirit turns away 
Just laying off for evidence 
An Overcoat of Clay. 
Death is like the insect 
Death is like the insect 
Menacing the tree, 
Competent to kill it, 
But decoyed may be. 
Bait it with the balsam, 
Seek it with the saw, 
Baffle, if it cost you 
Everything you are. 
Then, if it have burrowed 
Out of reach of skill Wring 
the tree and leave it, 
'Tis the vermin's will. 
Death Is Potential To That Man 
 
Death is potential to that Man 
Who dies&mdash;and to his friend&mdash; 
Beyond that&mdash;unconspicuous 
To Anyone but God&mdash; 
Of these Two&mdash;God remembers 
The longest&mdash;for the friend&mdash; 
Is integral&mdash;and therefore 
Itself dissolved&mdash;of God&mdash; 
Death Leaves Us Homesick, Who Behind 
Death leaves Us homesick, who behind, 
Except that it is gone 
Are ignorant of its Concern 
As if it were not born. 
Through all their former Places, we 
Like Individuals go 
Who something lost, the seeking for 
Is all that's left them, now— 
Death Sets A Thing Of Signigicant 
Death sets a thing significant 
The eye had hurried by, 
Except a perished creature 
Entreat us tenderly 
To ponder little workmanships 
In crayon or in wool, 
With 'This was last her fingers did,' 
Industrious until 
The thimble weighed too heavy, 
The stitches stopped themselves, 
And then 't was put among the dust 
Upon the closet shelves. 
A book I have, a friend gave, 
Whose pencil, here and there, 
Had notched the place that pleased him,-At 
rest his fingers are. 
Now, when I read, I read not, 
For interrupting tears 
Obliterate the etchings 
Too costly for repairs. 
Declaiming Waters None May Dread 
Declaiming Waters none may dread But 
Waters that are still 
Are so for that most fatal cause 
In Nature -they are full 
Defrauded I A Butterfly 
 
Defrauded I a Butterfly&mdash; 
The lawful Heir&mdash;for Thee&mdash; 
Delayed Till She Had Ceased To Know 
 
Delayed till she had ceased to know&mdash; 
Delayed till in its vest of snow 
Her loving bosom lay&mdash; 
An hour behind the fleeting breath&mdash; 
Later by just an hour than Death&mdash; 
Oh lagging Yesterday! 
Could she have guessed that it would be&mdash; 
Could but a crier of the joy 
Have climbed the distant hill&mdash; 
Had not the bliss so slow a pace 
Who knows but this surrendered face 
Were undefeated still? 
Oh if there may departing be 
Any forgot by Victory 
In her imperial round&mdash; 
Show them this meek appareled thing 
That could not stop to be a king&mdash; 
Doubtful if it be crowned! 
Delight Becomes Pictorial 
Delight becomes pictorial 
When viewed through pain,-More 
fair, because impossible 
That any gain. 
The mountaln at a given distance 
In amber lies; 
Approached, the amber flits a little,-And 
that's the skies! 
Delight Is As The Flight 
 
Delight is as the flight&mdash; 
Or in the Ratio of it, 
As the Schools would say&mdash; 
The Rainbow's way&mdash; 
A Skein 
Flung colored, after Rain, 
Would suit as bright, 
Except that flight 
Were Aliment&mdash; 
"If it would last" 
I asked the East, 
When that Bent Stripe 
Struck up my childish 
Firmament&mdash; 
And I, for glee, 
Took Rainbows, as the common way, 
And empty Skies 
The Eccentricity&mdash; 
And so with Lives&mdash; 
And so with Butterflies&mdash; 
Seen magic&mdash;through the fright 
That they will cheat the sight&mdash; 
And Dower latitudes far on&mdash; 
Some sudden morn&mdash; 
Our portion&mdash;in the fashion&mdash; 
Done&mdash; 
Denial&Mdash;Is The Only Fact 
 
Denial&mdash;is the only fact 
Perceived by the Denied&mdash; 
Whose Will&mdash;a numb significance&mdash; 
The Day the Heaven died&mdash; 
And all the Earth strove common round&mdash; 
Without Delight, or Beam&mdash; 
What Comfort was it Wisdom&mdash;was&mdash; 
The spoiler of Our Home? 
Departed To The Judgment, 
Departed to the judgment, 
A mighty afternoon; 
Great clouds like ushers leaning, 
Creation looking on. 
The flesh surrendered, cancelled 
The bodiless begun; 
Two worlds, like audiences, disperse 
And leave the soul alone. 
Deprived Of Other Banquet 
 
Deprived of other Banquet, 
I entertained Myself&mdash; 
At first&mdash;a scant nutrition&mdash; 
An insufficient Loaf&mdash; 
But grown by slender addings 
To so esteemed a size 
'Tis sumptuous enough for me&mdash; 
And almost to suffice 
A Robin's famine able&mdash;

Despair's advantage is achieved 
By suffering&mdash;Despair&mdash;

The Worthiness of Suffering like 
The Worthiness of Death 
Is ascertained by tasting&mdash; 
As can no other Mouth

Until Ourselves are struck&mdash;

Except as stimulants&mdash;in 
Cases of Despair&mdash; 
Or Stupor&mdash;The Reserve&mdash; 
These Heavenly Moments are&mdash; 
A Grant of the Divine&mdash; 
That Certain as it Comes&mdash; 
Withdraws&mdash;and leaves the dazzled Soul 
In her unfurnished Rooms 
Did The Harebell Loose Her Girdle 
 
Did the Harebell loose her girdle 
To the lover Bee 
Would the Bee the Harebell hallow 
Much as formerly? 
Did the "Paradise"&mdash;persuaded&mdash; 
Yield her moat of pearl&mdash; 
Would the Eden be an Eden, 
Or the Earl&mdash;an Earl? 
Did We Disobey Him? 
 
Did we disobey Him? 
Just one time! 
Charged us to forget Him&mdash; 
But we couldn't learn! 
Were Himself&mdash;such a Dunce&mdash; 
What would we&mdash;do? 
Love the dull lad&mdash;best&mdash; 
Oh, wouldn't you? 
Did You Ever Stand In A Cavern's Mouth 
 
Did you ever stand in a Cavern's Mouth&mdash; 
Widths out of the Sun&mdash; 
And look&mdash;and shudder, and block your breath&mdash; 
And deem to be alone 
In such a place, what horror, 
How Goblin it would be&mdash; 
And fly, as 'twere pursuing you? 
Then Loneliness&mdash;looks so&mdash; 
Did you ever look in a Cannon's face&mdash; 
Between whose Yellow eye&mdash; 
And yours&mdash;the Judgment intervened&mdash; 
The Question of "To die"&mdash; 
Extemporizing in your ear 
As cool as Satyr's Drums&mdash; 
If you remember, and were saved&mdash; 
It's liker so&mdash;it seems&mdash; 
Distrustful Of The Gentian 
 
Distrustful of the Gentian&mdash; 
And just to turn away, 
The fluttering of her fringes 
Child my perfidy&mdash; 
Weary for my&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; 
I will singing go&mdash; 
I shall not feel the sleet&mdash;then&mdash; 
I shall not fear the snow. 
Flees so the phantom meadow 
Before the breathless Bee&mdash; 
So bubble brooks in deserts 
On Ears that dying lie&mdash; 
Burn so the Evening Spires 
To Eyes that Closing go&mdash; 
Hangs so distant Heaven&mdash; 
To a hand below. 
Do People Moulder Equally 
 
Do People moulder equally, 
They bury, in the Grave? 
I do believe a Species 
As positively live 
As I, who testify it 
Deny that I&mdash;am dead&mdash; 
And fill my Lungs, for Witness&mdash; 
From Tanks&mdash;above my Head&mdash; 
I say to you, said Jesus&mdash; 
That there be standing here&mdash; 
A Sort, that shall not taste of Death&mdash; 
If Jesus was sincere&mdash; 
I need no further Argue&mdash; 
That statement of the Lord 
Is not a controvertible&mdash; 
He told me, Death was dead&mdash;

Don't put up my Thread and Needle&mdash;

When my mind&mdash;is plain 
I'll do seams&mdash;a Queen's endeavor 
Would not blush to own&mdash; 
Hems&mdash;too fine for Lady's tracing 
To the sightless Knot&mdash; 
Tucks&mdash;of dainty interspersion&mdash; 
Like a dotted Dot&mdash; 
Leave my Needle in the furrow&mdash; 
Where I put it down&mdash; 
I can make the zigzag stitches 
Straight&mdash;when I am strong&mdash; 
Till then&mdash;dreaming I am sewing 
Fetch the seam I missed&mdash; 
Closer&mdash;so I&mdash;at my sleeping&mdash; 
Still surmise I stitch&mdash;

Dust Is The Only Secret 
 
Dust is the only Secret&mdash; 
Death, the only One 
You cannot find out all about 
In his "native town." 
Nobody know "his Father"&mdash; 
Never was a Boy&mdash; 
Hadn't any playmates, 
Or "Early history"&mdash; 
Industrious! Laconic! 
Punctual! Sedate! 
Bold as a Brigand! 
Stiller than a Fleet! 
Builds, like a Bird, too! 
Christ robs the Nest&mdash; 
Robin after Robin 
Smuggled to Rest! 
Dying At My Music 
Dying at my music! 
Bubble! Bubble! 
Hold me till the Octave's run! 
Quick! Burst the Windows! 
Ritardando! 
Phials left, and the Sun! 
Dying! Dying In The Night! 
 
Dying! Dying in the night! 
Won't somebody bring the light 
So I can see which way to go 
Into the everlasting snow? 
And "Jesus"! Where is Jesus gone? 
They said that Jesus&mdash;always came&mdash; 
Perhaps he doesn't know the House&mdash; 
This way, Jesus, Let him pass! 
Somebody run to the great gate 
And see if Dollie's coming! Wait! 
I hear her feet upon the stair! 
Death won't hurt&mdash;now Dollie's here! 
Dying! To Be Afraid Of Thee 
 
Dying! To be afraid of thee 
One must to thine Artillery 
Have left exposed a Friend&mdash; 
Than thine old Arrow is a Shot 
Delivered straighter to the Heart 
The leaving Love behind. 
Not for itself, the Dust is shy, 
But, enemy, Beloved be 
Thy Batteries divorce. 
Fight sternly in a Dying eye 
Two Armies, Love and Certainty 
And Love and the Reverse. 
Each Life Converges To Some Centre 
Each life converges to some centre 
Expressed or still; 
Exists in every human nature 
A goal, 
Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be, 
Too fair 
For credibility's temerity 
To dare. 
Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven, 
To reach 
Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment 
To touch, 
Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance; 
How high 
Unto the saints' slow diligence 
The sky! 
Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture, 
But then, 
Eternity enables the endeavoring 
Again. 
Each Scar I'Ll Keep For Him 
 
Each Scar I'll keep for Him 
Instead I'll say of Gem 
In His long Absence worn 
A Costlier one 
But every Tear I bore 
Were He to count them o'er 
His own would fall so more 
I'll mis sum them. 
Each Second Is The Last 
 
Each Second is the last 
Perhaps, recalls the Man 
Just measuring unconsciousness 
The Sea and Spar between. 
To fail within a Chance&mdash; 
How terribler a thing 
Than perish from the Chance's list 
Before the Perishing! 
Elysium Is As Far As To 
Elysium is as far as to 
The very nearest Room 
If in that Room a Friend await 
Felicity or Doom-
What fortitude the Soul contains 
That it can so endure 
The accent of a coming Foot-The 
opening of a Door-
Emancipation 
No rack can torture me, 
My soul's at liberty 
Behind this mortal bone 
There knits a bolder one 
You cannot prick with saw, 
Nor rend with scymitar. 
Two bodies therefore be; 
Bind one, and one will flee. 
The eagle of his nest 
No easier divest 
And gain the sky, 
Than mayest thou, 
Except thyself may be 
Thine enemy; 
Captivity is consciousness, 
So's liberty. 
Embarrassment Of One Another 
 
Embarrassment of one another 
And God 
Is Revelation's limit, 
Aloud 
Is nothing that is chief, 
But still, 
Divinity dwells under a seal.

Empty my Heart, of Thee&mdash; 
Its single Artery&mdash;

Ended, ere it begun The 
Title was scarcely told 
When the Preface perished from Consciousness

Endow The Living—with The Tears 
 
Endow the Living—with the Tears— 
You squander on the Dead,

Around Your Fireside—

With Death's Ethereal Scron— 
Escape is such a thankful Word 
Escape is such a thankful Word 
I often in the Night 
Consider it unto myself 
No spectacle in sight 
Escape -it is the Basket 
In which the Heart is caught 
When down some awful Battlement 
The rest of Life is dropt 
'Tis not to sight the savior It 
is to be the saved And 
that is why I lay my Head 
Upon this trusty word 
Escaping Backward To Perceive 
 
Escaping backward to perceive 
The Sea upon our place&mdash; 
Escaping forward, to confront 
His glittering Embrace&mdash; 
Retreating up, a Billow's height 
Retreating blinded down 
Our undermining feet to meet 
Instructs to the Divine. 
Essential Oils—are Wrung 
 
Essential Oils—are wrung— 
The Attar from the Rose 
Be not expressed by Suns—alone— 
It is the gift of Screws— 
The General Rose—decay— 
But this—in Lady's Drawer 
Make Summer—When the Lady lie 
In Ceaseless Rosemary— 
Except The Heaven Had Come So Near 
 
Except the Heaven had come so near&mdash; 
So seemed to choose My Door&mdash; 
The Distance would not haunt me so&mdash; 
I had not hoped&mdash;before&mdash; 
But just to hear the Grace depart&mdash; 
I never thought to see&mdash; 
Afflicts me with a Double loss&mdash; 
'Tis lost&mdash;and lost to me&mdash; 
Except To Heaven, She Is Nought 
 
Except to Heaven, she is nought. 
Except for Angels&mdash;lone. 
Except to some wide-wandering Bee 
A flower superfluous blown. 
Except for winds&mdash;provincial. 
Except by Butterflies 
Unnoticed as a single dew 
That on the Acre lies. 
The smallest Housewife in the grass, 
Yet take her from the Lawn 
And somebody has lost the face 
That made Existence&mdash;Home! 
Exclusion (The Soul Selects Her Own Society) 
The soul selects her own society,
 Then shuts the door;
 On her divine majority
 Obtrude no more.
 Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
 At her low gate;
 Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
 Upon her mat.
 I've known her from an ample nation
 Choose one
 Then close the valves of her attention
 Like stone. 
Exhilaration is the Breeze 
Exhilaration is the Breeze 
That lifts us from the Ground 
And leaves us in another place 
Whose statement is not found 
Returns us not, but after time 
We soberly descend 
A little newer for the term 
Upon Enchanted Ground 
Exhilaration—is Within 
 
Exhilaration—is within— 
There can no Outer Wine 
So royally intoxicate 
As that diviner Brand 
The Soul achieves—Herself— 
To drink—or set away 
For Visitor—Or Sacrament— 
'Tis not of Holiday 
To stimulate a Man 
Who hath the Ample Rhine 
Within his Closet—Best you can 
Exhale in offering. 
Expectation—is Contentment 
 
Expectation—is Contentment— 
Gain—Satiety— 
But Satiety—Conviction 
Of Necessity 
Of an Austere trait in Pleasure— 
Good, without alarm 
Is a too established Fortune— 
Danger—deepens Sum— 
Experience Is The Angled Road 
 
Experience is the Angled Road 
Preferred against the Mind 
By&mdash;Paradox&mdash;the Mind itself&mdash; 
Presuming it to lead 
Quite Opposite&mdash;How Complicate 
The Discipline of Man&mdash; 
Compelling Him to Choose Himself 
His Preappointed Pain&mdash; 
Exultation Is The Going 
 
Exultation is the going 
Of an inland soul to sea, 
Past the houses&mdash;past the headlands&mdash; 
Into deep Eternity&mdash; 
Bred as we, among the mountains, 
Can the sailor understand 
The divine intoxication 
Of the first league out from land? 
Fairer Through Fading—as The Day 
 
Fairer through Fading—as the Day 
Into the Darkness dips away— 
Half Her Complexion of the Sun— 
Hindering—Haunting—Perishing— 
Rallies Her Glow, like a dying Friend— 
Teasing with glittering Amend— 
Only to aggravate the Dark 
Through an expiring—perfect—look— 
Faith 
'Faith' is a fine invention 
When Gentlemen can see— 
But Microscopes are prudent 
In an Emergency. 
'Faithful To The End' Amended 
'Faithful to the end' Amended 
From the Heavenly Clause Constancy 
with a Proviso 
Constancy abhors 
'Crowns of Life' are servile Prizes 
To the stately Heart, 
Given for the Giving, solely, 
No Emolument.

'Faithful to the end' Amended 
From the Heavenly clause Lucrative 
indeed the offer 
But the Heart withdraws 
'I will give' the base Proviso Spare 
Your 'Crown of Life' Those 
it fits, too fair to wear it Try 
it on Yourself 
Faith—is The Pierless Bridge 
 
Faith—is the Pierless Bridge 
Supporting what We see 
Unto the Scene that We do not— 
Too slender for the eye 
It bears the Soul as bold 
As it were rocked in Steel 
With Arms of Steel at either side— 
It joins—behind the Veil 
To what, could We presume 
The Bridge would cease to be 
To Our far, vacillating Feet 
A first Necessity. 
Fame Is A Bee 
 
Fame is a bee. 
It has a song&mdash; 
It has a sting&mdash; 
Ah, too, it has a wing. 
Fame Is A Fickle Food (1659) 
Fame is a fickle food 
Upon a shifting plate 
Whose table once a 
Guest but not 
The second time is set. 
Whose crumbs the crows inspect 
And with ironic caw 
Flap past it to the Farmer's Corn-Men 
eat of it and die. 
Fame Is The Tine That Scholars Leave 
 
Fame is the tine that Scholars leave 
Upon their Setting Names&mdash; 
The Iris not of Occident 
That disappears as comes&mdash; 
Fame Of Myself, To Justify 
 
Fame of Myself, to justify, 
All other Plaudit be 
Superfluous&mdash;An Incense 
Beyond Necessity&mdash; 
Fame of Myself to lack&mdash;Although 
My Name be else Supreme&mdash; 
This were an Honor honorless&mdash; 
A futile Diadem&mdash; 
Fate Slew Him, But He Did Not Drop 
FATE slew him, but he did not drop; 
She felled—he did not fall— 
Impaled him on her fiercest stakes— 
He neutralized them all. 
She stung him, sapped his firm advance, 
But, when her worst was done, 
And he, unmoved, regarded her, 
Acknowledged him a man. 
Finding Is The First Act 
 
Finding is the first Act

Finite—to Fail, But Infinite To Venture 
 
Finite—to fail, but infinite to Venture— 
For the one ship that struts the shore 
Many's the gallant—overwhelmed Creature 
Nodding in Navies nevermore— 
First Robin 
I dreaded that first robin so, 
But he is mastered now, 
And I'm accustomed to him grown,-He 
hurts a little, though. 
I thought if I could only live 
Till that first shout got by, 
Not all pianos in the woods 
Had power to mangle me. 
I dared not meet the daffodils, 
For fear their yellow gown 
Would pierce me with a fashion 
So foreign to my own. 
I wished the grass would hurry, 
So when 't was time to see, 
He'd be too tall, the tallest one 
Could stretch to look at me. 
I could not bear the bees should come, 
I wished they'd stay away 
In those dim countries where they go: 
What word had they for me? 
They're here, though; not a creature failed, 
No blossom stayed away 
In gentle deference to me, 
The Queen of Calvary. 
Each one salutes me as he goes, 
And I my childish plumes 
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment 
Of their unthinking drums. 
Fitter To See Him, I May Be 
 
Fitter to see Him, I may be 
For the long Hindrance&mdash;Grace&mdash;to Me&mdash; 
With Summers, and with Winters, grow, 
Some passing Year&mdash;A trait bestow 
To make Me fairest of the Earth&mdash; 
The Waiting&mdash;then&mdash;will seem so worth 
I shall impute with half a pain 
The blame that I was chosen&mdash;then&mdash; 
Time to anticipate His Gaze&mdash; 
It's first&mdash;Delight&mdash;and then&mdash;Surprise&mdash; 
The turning o'er and o'er my face 
For Evidence it be the Grace&mdash; 
He left behind One Day&mdash;So less 
He seek Conviction, That&mdash;be This&mdash; 
I only must not grow so new 
That He'll mistake&mdash;and ask for me 
Of me&mdash;when first unto the Door 
I go&mdash;to Elsewhere go no more&mdash; 
I only must not change so fair 
He'll sigh&mdash;"The Other&mdash;She&mdash;is Where?" 
The Love, tho', will array me right 
I shall be perfect&mdash;in His sight&mdash; 
If He perceive the other Truth&mdash; 
Upon an Excellenter Youth&mdash; 
How sweet I shall not lack in Vain&mdash; 
But gain&mdash;thro' loss&mdash;Through Grief&mdash;obtain&mdash; 
The Beauty that reward Him best&mdash; 
The Beauty of Demand&mdash;at Rest&mdash; 
Flowers—well—if Anybody 
 
Flowers—Well—if anybody 
Can the ecstasy define— 
Half a transport—half a trouble— 
With which flowers humble men: 
Anybody find the fountain 
From which floods so contra flow— 
I will give him all the Daisies 
Which upon the hillside blow. 
Too much pathos in their faces 
For a simple breast like mine— 
Butterflies from St. Domingo 
Cruising round the purple line— 
Have a system of aesthetics— 
Far superior to mine. 
For Death—or Rather 
 
For Death—or rather 
For the Things 'twould buy— 
This—put away 
Life's Opportunity— 
The Things that Death will buy 
Are Room— 
Escape from Circumstances— 
And a Name— 
With Gifts of Life 
How Death's Gifts may compare— 
We know not— 
For the Rates—lie Here— 
For Each Ecstatic Instant 
For each ecstatic instant 
We must an anguish pay 
In keen and quivering ratio 
To the ectasty. 
For each beloved hour 
Sharp pittances of years, 
Bitter contested farthings 
And coffers heaped with tears. 
For Every Bird A Nest 
 
For every Bird a Nest&mdash; 
Wherefore in timid quest 
Some little Wren goes seeking round&mdash; 
Wherefore when boughs are free&mdash; 
Households in every tree&mdash; 
Pilgrim be found? 
Perhaps a home too high&mdash; 
Ah Aristocracy! 
The little Wren desires&mdash; 
Perhaps of twig so fine&mdash; 
Of twine e'en superfine, 
Her pride aspires&mdash; 
The Lark is not ashamed 
To build upon the ground 
Her modest house&mdash; 
Yet who of all the throng 
Dancing around the sun 
Does so rejoice? 
For Largest Woman's Hearth I Knew 
 
For largest Woman's Hearth I knew&mdash; 
'Tis little I can do&mdash; 
And yet the largest Woman's Heart 
Could hold an Arrow&mdash;too&mdash; 
And so, instructed by my own, 
I tenderer, turn Me to. 
For This—accepted Breath 
 
For this—accepted Breath— 
Through it—compete with Death— 
The fellow cannot touch this Crown— 
By it—my title take— 
Ah, what a royal sake 
To my necessity—stooped down! 
No Wilderness—can be 
Where this attendeth me— 
No Desert Noon— 
No fear of frost to come 
Haunt the perennial bloom— 
But Certain June! 
Get Gabriel—to tell—the royal syllable— 
Get Saints—with new—unsteady tongue— 
To say what trance below 
Most like their glory show— 
Fittest the Crown!

Frequently The Wood Are Pink 
 
Frequently the wood are pink&mdash; 
Frequently are brown. 
Frequently the hills undress 
Behind my native town. 
Oft a head is crested 
I was wont to see&mdash; 
And as oft a cranny 
Where it used to be&mdash; 
And the Earth&mdash; they tell me&mdash; 
On its Axis turned! 
Wonderful Rotation! 
By but twelve performed! 
From Blank To Blank 
 
From Blank to Blank&mdash; 
A Threadless Way 
I pushed Mechanic feet&mdash; 
To stop&mdash;or perish&mdash;or advance&mdash; 
Alike indifferent&mdash; 
If end I gained 
It ends beyond 
Indefinite disclosed&mdash; 
I shut my eyes&mdash;and groped as well 
'Twas lighter&mdash;to be Blind&mdash; 
From Cocoon Forth A Butterfly 
 
From Cocoon forth a Butterfly 
As Lady from her Door 
Emerged&mdash;a Summer Afternoon&mdash; 
Repairing Everywhere&mdash; 
Without Design&mdash;that I could trace 
Except to stray abroad 
On Miscellaneous Enterprise 
The Clovers&mdash;understood&mdash; 
Her pretty Parasol be seen 
Contracting in a Field 
Where Men made Hay&mdash; 
Then struggling hard 
With an opposing Cloud&mdash; 
Where Parties&mdash;Phantom as Herself&mdash; 
To Nowhere&mdash;seemed to go 
In purposeless Circumference&mdash; 
As 'twere a Tropic Show&mdash; 
And notwithstanding Bee&mdash;that worked&mdash; 
And Flower&mdash;that zealous blew&mdash; 
This Audience of Idleness 
Disdained them, from the Sky&mdash; 
Till Sundown crept&mdash;a steady Tide&mdash; 
And Men that made the Hay&mdash; 
And Afternoon&mdash;and Butterfly&mdash; 
Extinguished&mdash;in the Sea&mdash; 
From The Chrysalis 
My cocoon tightens, colors tease, 
I'm feeling for the air; 
A dim capacity for wings 
Degrades the dress I wear. 
A power of butterfly must be 
The aptitude to fly, 
Meadows of majesty concedes 
And easy sweeps of sky. 
So I must baffle at the hint 
And cipher at the sign, 
And make much blunder, if at last 
I take the clew divine. 
From Us She Wandered Now A Year 
 
From Us She wandered now a Year, 
Her tarrying, unknown, 
If Wilderness prevent her feet 
Or that Ethereal Zone 
No eye hath seen and lived 
We ignorant must be&mdash; 
We only know what time of Year 
We took the Mystery. 
Funny—to Be A Century 
 
Funny—to be a Century—

So dainty of Publicity—

Enlarging Loneliness.

Glowing Is Her Bonnet 
 
Glowing is her Bonnet, 
Glowing is her Cheek, 
Glowing is her Kirtle, 
Yet she cannot speak. 
Better as the Daisy 
From the Summer hill 
Vanish unrecorded 
Save by tearful rill&mdash; 
Save by loving sunrise 
Looking for her face. 
Save by feet unnumbered 
Pausing at the place. 
God Gave A Loaf To Every Bird, 
God gave a loaf to every bird, 
But just a crumb to me; 
I dare not eat it, though I starve,-My 
poignant luxury 
To own it, touch it, prove the feat 
That made the pellet mine,-Too 
happy in my sparrow chance 
For ampler coveting. 
It might be famine all around, 
I could not miss an ear, 
Such plenty smiles upon my board, 
My garner shows so fair. 
I wonder how the rich may feel,-An 
Indiaman--an Earl? 
I deem that I with but a crumb 
Am sovereign of them all. 
God Is A Distant—stately Lover 
 
God is a distant—stately Lover— 
Woos, as He states us—by His Son— 
Verily, a Vicarious Courtship— 
"Miles", and "Priscilla", were such an One— 
But, lest the Soul—like fair "Priscilla" 
Choose the Envoy—and spurn the Groom— 
Vouches, with hyperbolic archness— 
"Miles", and "John Alden" were Synonym—

God made a little Gentian&mdash; 
It tried&mdash;to be a Rose&mdash; 
And failed&mdash;and all the Summer laughed&mdash; 
But just before the Snows 
There rose a Purple Creature&mdash; 
That ravished all the Hill&mdash; 
And Summer hid her Forehead&mdash; 
And Mockery&mdash;was still&mdash; 
The Frosts were her condition&mdash; 
The Tyrian would not come 
Until the North&mdash;invoke it&mdash; 
Creator&mdash;Shall I&mdash;bloom? 
God Permit Industrious Angels 
God permit industrious angels 
Afternoons to play. 
I met one, -- forgot my school-mates, 
All, for him, straightaway. 
God calls home the angels promptly 
At the setting sun; 
I missed mine. How dreary marbles, 
After playing the Crown! 
Going To Heaven! 
 
Going to Heaven! 
I don't know when&mdash; 
Pray do not ask me how! 
Indeed I'm too astonished 
To think of answering you! 
Going to Heaven! 
How dim it sounds! 
And yet it will be done 
As sure as flocks go home at night 
Unto the Shepherd's arm! 
Perhaps you're going too! 
Who knows? 
If you should get there first 
Save just a little space for me 
Close to the two I lost&mdash; 
The smallest "Robe" will fit me 
And just a bit of "Crown"&mdash; 
For you know we do not mind our dress 
When we are going home&mdash; 
I'm glad I don't believe it 
For it would stop my breath&mdash; 
And I'd like to look a little more 
At such a curious Earth! 
I'm glad they did believe it 
Whom I have never found 
Since the might Autumn afternoon 
I left them in the ground. 
Going To Him! Happy Letter! Tell Him-
Going to him! Happy letter! Tell him-Tell 
him the page I didn't write; 
Tell him I only said the syntax, 
And left the verb and the pronoun out. 
Tell him just how the fingers hurried 
Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow-
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages, 
So you could see what moved them so. 
'Tell him it wasn't a practised writer, 
You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled; 
You could hear the bodice tug, behind you, 
As if it held but the might of a child; 
You almost pitied it, you, it worked so. 
Tell him--No, you may quibble there, 
For it would split his heart to know it, 
And then you and I were silenter. 
'Tell him night finished before we finished 
And the old clock kept neighing 'day!' 
And you got sleepy and begged to be ended-What 
could it hinder so, to say? 
Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious 
But if he ask where you are hid 
Until to-morrow,--happy letter! 
Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!' 
Good Morning—midnight 
 
Good Morning—Midnight— 
I'm coming Home— 
Day—got tired of Me— 
How could I—of Him? 
Sunshine was a sweet place— 
I liked to stay— 
But Morn—didn't want me—now— 
So—Goodnight—Day! 
I can look—can't I—

The Hills—have a way—then—

You—are not so fair—Midnight—

Good Night! Which Put The Candle Out? 
Good night! which put the candle out? 
A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.
 Ah! friend, you little knew 
How long at that celestial wick 
The angels labored diligent;
 Extinguished, now, for you! 
It might have been the lighthouse spark 
Some sailor, rowing in the dark,
 Had importuned to see! 
It might have been the waning lamp 
That lit the drummer from the camp
 To purer reveille! 
Good Night, Because We Must 
 
Good night, because we must, 
How intricate the dust! 
I would go, to know! 
Oh incognito! 
Saucy, Saucy Seraph 
To elude me so! 
Father! they won't tell me, 
Won't you tell them to? 
Good To Hide, And Hear 'Em Hunt! 
 
Good to hide, and hear 'em hunt! 
Better, to be found, 
If one care to, that is, 
The Fox fits the Hound&mdash; 
Good to know, and not tell, 
Best, to know and tell, 
Can one find the rare Ear 
Not too dull&mdash; 
Gratitude—is Not The Mention 
 
Gratitude—is not the mention 
Of a Tenderness, 
But its still appreciation 
Out of Plumb of Speech. 
When the Sea return no Answer

A Favor so remote&mdash; 
The failure but confirm the Grace 
In further Infinite&mdash; 
'Tis failure&mdash;not of Hope&mdash; 
But Confident Despair&mdash; 
Advancing on Celestial Lists&mdash; 
With faint&mdash;Terrestial power&mdash; 
'Tis Honor&mdash;though I die&mdash; 
For That no Man obtain 
Till He be justified by Death&mdash; 
This&mdash;is the Second Gain&mdash; 
Had we our senses 
Had we our senses 
But perhaps 'tis well they're not at Home 
So intimate with Madness 
He's liable with them 
Had we the eyes without our Head— 
How well that we are Blind— 
We could not look upon the Earth— 
So utterly unmoved— 
Have Any Like Myself 
 
Have any like Myself 
Investigating March, 
New Houses on the Hill descried&mdash; 
And possibly a Church&mdash; 
That were not, We are sure&mdash; 
As lately as the Snow&mdash; 
And are Today&mdash;if We exist&mdash; 
Though how may this be so? 
Have any like Myself 
Conjectured Who may be 
The Occupants of the Adobes&mdash; 
So easy to the Sky&mdash; 
'Twould seem that God should be 
The nearest Neighbor to&mdash; 
And Heaven&mdash;a convenient Grace 
For Show, or Company&mdash; 
Have any like Myself 
Preserved the Charm secure 
By shunning carefully the Place 
All Seasons of the Year, 
Excepting March&mdash;'Tis then 
My Villages be seen&mdash; 
And possibly a Steeple&mdash; 
Not afterward&mdash;by Men&mdash; 
Have You Got A Brook In Your Little Heart 
 
Have you got a Brook in your little heart, 
Where bashful flowers blow, 
And blushing birds go down to drink, 
And shadows tremble so&mdash; 
And nobody knows, so still it flows, 
That any brook is there, 
And yet your little draught of life 
Is daily drunken there&mdash; 
Why, look out for the little brook in March, 
When the rivers overflow, 
And the snows come hurrying from the fills, 
And the bridges often go&mdash; 
And later, in August it may be&mdash; 
When the meadows parching lie, 
Beware, lest this little brook of life, 
Some burning noon go dry! 
He ate and drank the precious Words 
He ate and drank the precious Words His 
Spirit grew robust He 
knew no more that he was poor, 
Nor that his frame was Dust 
He danced along the dingy Days 
And this Bequest of Wings 
Was but a Book -What Liberty 
A loosened spirit brings 
He Forgot—and I—remembered 
 
He forgot—and I—remembered— 
'Twas an everyday affair— 
Long ago as Christ and Peter— 
"Warmed them" at the "Temple fire." 
"Thou wert with him"—quoth "the Damsel"? 
"No"—said Peter, 'twasn't me— 
Jesus merely "looked" at Peter— 
Could I do aught else—to Thee? 
He Fought Like Those Who'Ve Nought To Lose 
 
He fought like those Who've nought to lose&mdash; 
Bestowed Himself to Balls 
As One who for a further Life 
Had not a further Use&mdash; 
Invited Death&mdash;with bold attempt&mdash; 
But Death was Coy of Him 
As Other Men, were Coy of Death&mdash; 
To Him&mdash;to live&mdash;was Doom&mdash; 
His Comrades, shifted like the Flakes 
When Gusts reverse the Snow&mdash; 
But He&mdash;was left alive Because 
Of Greediness to die&mdash; 
He Found My Being—set It Up 
 
He found my Being—set it up— 
Adjusted it to place— 
Then carved his name—upon it— 
And bade it to the East 
Be faithful—in his absence— 
And he would come again— 
With Equipage of Amber— 
That time—to take it Home— 
He Fumbles At Your Soul 
 
He fumbles at your Soul 
As Players at the Keys 
Before they drop full Music on&mdash; 
He stuns you by degrees&mdash; 
Prepares your brittle Nature 
For the Ethereal Blow 
By fainter Hammers&mdash;further heard&mdash; 
Then nearer&mdash;Then so slow 
Your Breath has time to straighten&mdash; 
Your Brain&mdash;to bubble Cool&mdash; 
Deals&mdash;One&mdash;imperial&mdash;Thunderbolt&mdash; 
That scalps your naked Soul&mdash; 
When Winds take Forests in the Paws&mdash; 
The Universe&mdash;is still&mdash; 
He Fumbles At Your Spirit 
He fumbles at your spirit 
As players at the keys 
Before they drop full music on; 
He stuns you by degrees, 
Prepares your brittle substance 
For the ethereal blow, 
By fainter hammers, further heard, 
Then nearer, then so slow 
Your breath has time to straighten, 
Your brain to bubble cool, -
Deals one imperial thunderbolt 
That scalps your naked soul. 
He Gave Away His Life 
 
He gave away his Life&mdash; 
To Us&mdash;Gigantic Sum&mdash; 
A trifle&mdash;in his own esteem&mdash; 
But magnified&mdash;by Fame&mdash; 
Until it burst the Hearts 
That fancied they could hold&mdash; 
When swift it slipped its limit&mdash; 
And on the Heavens&mdash;unrolled&mdash; 
'Tis Ours&mdash;to wince&mdash;and weep&mdash; 
And wonder&mdash;and decay 
By Blossoms gradual process&mdash; 
He chose&mdash;Maturity&mdash; 
And quickening&mdash;as we sowed&mdash; 
Just obviated Bud&mdash; 
And when We turned to note the Growth&mdash; 
Broke&mdash;perfect&mdash;from the Pod&mdash; 
He Outstripped Time With But A Bout 
 
He outstripped Time with but a Bout, 
He outstripped Stars and Sun 
And then, unjaded, challenged God 
In presence of the Throne. 
And He and He in mighty List 
Unto this present, run, 
The larger Glory for the less 
A just sufficient Ring. 
He Parts Himself—like Leaves 
 
He parts Himself—like Leaves— 
And then—He closes up— 
Then stands upon the Bonnet 
Of Any Buttercup— 
And then He runs against 
And oversets a Rose— 
And then does Nothing— 
Then away upon a Jib—He goes— 
And dangles like a Mote 
Suspended in the Noon— 
Uncertain—to return Below— 
Or settle in the Moon— 
What come of Him—at Night— 
The privilege to say 
Be limited by Ignorance— 
What come of Him—That Day— 
The Frost—possess the World— 
In Cabinets—be shown— 
A Sepulchre of quaintest Floss— 
An Abbey—a Cocoon— 
He Preached Upon 'Breadth' Till It Argued Him Narrow 
— 
He preached upon 'Breadth' till it argued him narrow The 
Broad are too broad to define 
And of 'Truth' until it proclaimed him a Liar The 
Truth never flaunted a Sign 
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence 
As Gold the Pyrites would shun What 
confusion would cover the innocent Jesus 
To meet so enabled a Man! 
He Put The Belt Around My Life 
 
He put the Belt around my life 
I heard the Buckle snap&mdash; 
And turned away, imperial, 
My Lifetime folding up&mdash; 
Deliberate, as a Duke would do 
A Kingdom's Title Deed&mdash; 
Henceforth, a Dedicated sort&mdash; 
A Member of the Cloud. 
Yet not too far to come at call&mdash; 
And do the little Toils 
That make the Circuit of the Rest&mdash; 
And deal occasional smiles 
To lives that stoop to notice mine&mdash; 
And kindly ask it in&mdash; 
Whose invitation, know you not 
For Whom I must decline? 
He Strained My Faith 
 
He strained my faith&mdash; 
Did he find it supple? 
Shook my strong trust&mdash; 
Did it then&mdash;yield? 
Hurled my belief&mdash; 
But&mdash;did he shatter&mdash;it? 
Racked&mdash;with suspense&mdash; 
Not a nerve failed! 
Wrung me&mdash;with Anguish&mdash; 
But I never doubted him&mdash; 
'Tho' for what wrong 
He did never say&mdash; 
Stabbed&mdash;while I sued 
His sweet forgiveness&mdash; 
Jesus&mdash;it's your little "John"! 
Don't you know&mdash;me? 
He Told A Homely Tale 
 
He told a homely tale 
And spotted it with tears&mdash; 
Upon his infant face was set 
The Cicatrice of years&mdash; 
All crumpled was the cheek 
No other kiss had known 
Than flake of snow, divided with 
The Redbreast of the Barn&mdash; 
If Mother&mdash;in the Grave&mdash; 
Or Father&mdash;on the Sea&mdash; 
Or Father in the Firmament&mdash; 
Or Brethren, had he&mdash; 
If Commonwealth below, 
Or Commonwealth above 
Have missed a Barefoot Citizen&mdash; 
I've ransomed it&mdash;alive&mdash; 
He Touched Me, So I Live To Know 
 
He touched me, so I live to know 
That such a day, permitted so, 
I groped upon his breast&mdash; 
It was a boundless place to me 
And silenced, as the awful sea 
Puts minor streams to rest. 
And now, I'm different from before, 
As if I breathed superior air&mdash; 
Or brushed a Royal Gown&mdash; 
My feet, too, that had wandered so&mdash; 
My Gypsy face&mdash;transfigured now&mdash; 
To tenderer Renown&mdash; 
Into this Port, if I might come, 
Rebecca, to Jerusalem, 
Would not so ravished turn&mdash; 
Nor Persian, baffled at her shrine 
Lift such a Crucifixial sign 
To her imperial Sun. 
He Was Weak, And I Was Strong—then 
 
He was weak, and I was strong—then— 
So He let me lead him in— 
I was weak, and He was strong then— 
So I let him lead me—Home. 
'Twasn't far—the door was near— 
'Twasn't dark—for He went—too— 
'Twasn't loud, for He said nought— 
That was all I cared to know. 
Day knocked—and we must part— 
Neither—was strongest—now— 
He strove—and I strove—too— 
We didn't do it—tho'! 
He Who In Himself Believes 
 
He who in Himself believes&mdash; 
Fraud cannot presume&mdash; 
Faith is Constancy's Result&mdash; 
And assumes&mdash;from Home&mdash; 
Cannot perish, though it fail 
Every second time&mdash; 
But defaced Vicariously&mdash; 
For Some Other Shame&mdash; 
Heart, Not So Heavy As Mine 
 
Heart, not so heavy as mine 
Wending late home&mdash; 
As it passed my window 
Whistled itself a tune&mdash; 
A careless snatch&mdash;a ballad&mdash;A ditty of the street&mdash; 
Yet to my irritated Ear 
An Anodyne so sweet&mdash; 
It was as if a Bobolink 
Sauntering this way 
Carolled, and paused, and carolled&mdash; 
Then bubbled slow away! 
It was as if a chirping brook 
Upon a dusty way&mdash; 
Set bleeding feet to minuets 
Without the knowing why! 
Tomorrow, night will come again&mdash; 
Perhaps, weary and sore&mdash; 
Ah Bugle! By my window 
I pray you pass once more. 
Heart, We Will Forget Him 
Heart, we will forget him, 
You and I, tonight! 
You must forget the warmth he gave, 
I will forget the light. 
When you have done pray tell me, 
Then I, my thoughts, will dim. 
Haste! ‘lest while you’re lagging 
I may remember him! 
Heaven Has Different Signs—to Me 
"Heaven" has different Signs—to me— 
Sometimes, I think that Noon 
Is but a symbol of the Place— 
And when again, at Dawn, 
A mighty look runs round the World 
And settles in the Hills— 
An Awe if it should be like that 
Upon the Ignorance steals— 
The Orchard, when the Sun is on— 
The Triumph of the Birds 
When they together Victory make— 
Some Carnivals of Clouds— 
The Rapture of a finished Day— 
Returning to the West— 
All these—remind us of the place 
That Men call "paradise"— 
Itself be fairer—we suppose— 
But how Ourself, shall be 
Adorned, for a Superior Grace— 
Not yet, our eyes can see— 
Heaven Is So Far Of The Mind 
 
Heaven is so far of the Mind 
That were the Mind dissolved&mdash; 
The Site&mdash;of it&mdash;by Architect 
Could not again be proved&mdash; 
'Tis vast&mdash;as our Capacity&mdash; 
As fair&mdash;as our idea&mdash; 
To Him of adequate desire 
No further 'tis, than Here&mdash; 
Heavenly Father 
'Heavenly Father' -take to thee 
The supreme iniquity 
Fashioned by thy candid Hand 
In a moment contraband Though 
to trust us -seems to us 
More respectful -'We are Dust' We 
apologize to thee 
For thine own Duplicity 
Her— 
 
Her—"last Poems"— 
Poets—ended— 
Silver—perished—with her Tongue— 
Not on Record—bubbled other, 
Flute—or Woman— 
So divine— 
Not unto its Summer—Morning 
Robin—uttered Half the Tune— 
Gushed too free for the Adoring— 
From the Anglo-Florentine— 
Late—the Praise— 
'Tis dull—conferring 
On the Head too High to Crown— 
Diadem—or Ducal Showing— 
Be its Grave—sufficient sign— 
Nought—that We—No Poet's Kinsman— 
Suffocate—with easy woe— 
What, and if, Ourself a Bridegroom— 
Put Her down—in Italy? 
Her Breast Is Fit For Pearls 
 
Her breast is fit for pearls, 
But I was not a "Diver"&mdash; 
Her brow is fit for thrones 
But I have not a crest. 
Her heart is fit for home&mdash; 
I&mdash;a Sparrow&mdash;build there 
Sweet of twigs and twine 
My perennial nest. 
Her Final Summer Was It, 
Her final summer was it, 
And yet we guessed it not; 
If tenderer industriousness 
Pervaded her, we thought 
A further force of life 
Developed from within,-When 
Death lit all the shortness up, 
And made the hurry plain. 
We wondered at our blindness,-When 
nothing was to see 
But her Carrara guide-post,-At 
our stupidity 
When, duller than our dulness, 
The busy darling lay, 
So busy was she, finishing, 
So leisurely were we! 
Her Grace Is All She Has&Mdash; 
 
Her Grace is all she has&mdash; 
And that, so least displays&mdash; 
One Art to recognize, must be, 
Another Art, to praise. 
Her Smile Was Shaped Like Other Smiles 
 
Her smile was shaped like other smiles&mdash; 
The Dimples ran along&mdash; 
And still it hurt you, as some Bird 
Did hoist herself, to sing, 
Then recollect a Ball, she got&mdash; 
And hold upon the Twig, 
Convulsive, while the Music broke&mdash; 
Like Beads&mdash;among the Bog&mdash; 
Her Sweet Turn To Leave The Homestead 
 
Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead 
Came the Darker Way&mdash; 
Carriages&mdash;Be Sure&mdash;and Guests&mdash;too&mdash; 
But for Holiday 
'Tis more pitiful Endeavor 
Than did Loaded Sea 
O'er the Curls attempt to caper 
It had cast away&mdash; 
Never Bride had such Assembling&mdash; 
Never kinsmen kneeled 
To salute so fair a Forehead&mdash; 
Garland be indeed&mdash; 
Fitter Feet&mdash;of Her before us&mdash; 
Than whatever Brow 
Art of Snow&mdash;or Trick of Lily 
Possibly bestow 
Of Her Father&mdash;Whoso ask Her&mdash; 
He shall seek as high 
As the Palm&mdash;that serve the Desert&mdash; 
To obtain the Sky&mdash; 
Distance&mdash;be Her only Motion&mdash; 
If 'tis Nay&mdash;or Yes&mdash; 
Acquiescence&mdash;or Demurral&mdash; 
Whosoever guess&mdash; 
He&mdash;must pass the Crystal Angle 
That obscure Her face&mdash; 
He&mdash;must have achieved in person 
Equal Paradise&mdash; 
Her Sweet Weight On My Heart A Night 
 
Her sweet Weight on my Heart a Night 
Had scarcely deigned to lie&mdash; 
When, stirring, for Belief's delight, 
My Bride had slipped away&mdash; 
If 'twas a Dream&mdash;made solid&mdash;just 
The Heaven to confirm&mdash; 
Or if Myself were dreamed of Her&mdash; 
The power to presume&mdash; 
With Him remain&mdash;who unto Me&mdash; 
Gave&mdash;even as to All&mdash; 
A Fiction superseding Faith&mdash; 
By so much&mdash;as 'twas real&mdash;

Herein a Blossom lies&mdash; 
A Sepulchre, between&mdash;

High From The Earth I Heard A Bird 
High from the earth I heard a bird; 
He trod upon the trees 
As he esteemed them trifles, 
And then he spied a breeze, 
And situated softly 
Upon a pile of wind 
Which in a perturbation 
Nature had left behind. 
A joyous-going fellow 
I gathered from his talk, 
Which both of benediction 
And badinage partook, 
Without apparent burden, 
I learned, in leafy wood 
He was the faithful father 
Of a dependent brood; 
And this untoward transport 
His remedy for care,— 
A contrast to our respites. 
How different we are! 
His Bill An Auger Is 
 
His Bill an Auger is, 
His Head, a Cap and Frill. 
He laboreth at every Tree 
A Worm, His utmost Goal. 
His Feet Are Shod With Gauze 
 
His Feet are shod with Gauze&mdash; 
His Helmet, is of Gold, 
His Breast, a Single Onyx 
With Chrysophrase, inlaid. 
His Labor is a Chant&mdash; 
His Idleness&mdash;a Tune&mdash; 
Oh, for a Bee's experience 
Of Clovers, and of Noon! 
His Heart Was Darker Than The Starless Night 
His Heart was darker than the starless night 
For that there is a morn 
But in this black Receptacle 
Can be no Bode of Dawn 
His voice decrepit was with Joy 
His voice decrepit was with Joy Her 
words did totter so 
How old the News of Love must be 
To make Lips elderly 
That purled a moment since with Glee Is 
it Delight or Woe Or 
Terror -that do decorate 
This livid interview 
Home 
Years I had been from home, 
And now, before the door 
I dared not open, lest a face 
I never saw before 
Stare vacant into mine 
And ask my business there. 
My business, - just a life I left, 
Was such still dwelling there? 
I fumbled at my nerve, 
I scanned the windows near; 
The silence like an ocean rolled, 
And broke against my ear. 
I laughed a wooden laugh 
That I could fear a door, 
Who danger and the dead had faced, 
But never quaked before. 
I fitted to the latch 
My hand, with trembling care, 
Lest back the awful door should spring, 
And leave me standing there. 
I moved my fingers off 
As cautiously as glass, 
And held my ears, and like a thief 
Fled gasping from the house. 
Hope is a strange invention 
Hope is a strange invention A 
Patent of the Heart In 
unremitting action 
Yet never wearing out 
Of this electric Adjunct 
Not anything is known 
But its unique momentum 
Embellish all we own 
Hope Is The Thing With Feathers 
'Hope' is the thing with feathers— 
That perches in the soul— 
And sings the tune without the words— 
And never stops—at all— 
And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard— 
And sore must be the storm— 
That could abash the little Bird 
That kept so many warm— 
I've heard it in the chillest land— 
And on the strangest Sea— 
Yet, never, in Extremity, 
It asked a crumb—of Me. 
Houses—so The Wise Men Tell Me— 
"Houses"—so the Wise Men tell me— 
"Mansions"! Mansions must be warm! 
Mansions cannot let the tears in, 
Mansions must exclude the storm! 
"Many Mansions," by "his Father," 
I don't know him; snugly built! 
Could the Children find the way there— 
Some, would even trudge tonight! 
How Far Is It To Heaven? 
 
How far is it to Heaven? 
As far as Death this way&mdash; 
Of River or of Ridge beyond 
Was no discovery. 
How far is it to Hell? 
As far as Death this way&mdash; 
How far left hand the Sepulchre 
Defies Topography. 
How firm Eternity must look 
How firm Eternity must look 
To crumbling men like me 
The only Adamant Estate 
In all Identity 
How mighty to the insecure 
Thy Physiognomy 
To whom not any Face cohere Unless 
concealed in thee 
How fits his Umber Coat 
How fits his Umber Coat 
The Tailor of the Nut? 
Combined without a seam 
Like Raiment of a Dream 
Who spun the Auburn Cloth? 
Computed how the girth? 
The Chestnut aged grows 
In those primeval Clothes 
We know that we are wise Accomplished 
in Surprise Yet 
by this Countryman This 
nature -how undone! 
How Fortunate The Grave 
 
How fortunate the Grave&mdash; 
All Prizes to obtain&mdash; 
Successful certain, if at last, 
First Suitor not in vain. 
How Happy I Was If I Could Forget 
 
How happy I was if I could forget 
To remember how sad I am 
Would be an easy adversity 
But the recollecting of Bloom 
Keeps making November difficult 
Till I who was almost bold 
Lose my way like a little Child 
And perish of the cold. 
How Happy Is The Little Stone 
 
How happy is the little Stone 
That rambles in the Road alone, 
And doesn't care about Careers 
And Exigencies never fears&mdash; 
Whose Coat of elemental Brown 
A passing Universe put on, 
And independent as the Sun 
Associates or glows alone, 
Fulfilling absolute Decree 
In casual simplicity&mdash; 
How Human Nature dotes 
How Human Nature dotes 
On what it can't detect. 
The moment that a Plot is plumbed 
Prospective is extinct 
Prospective is the friend 
Reserved for us to know 
When Constancy is clarified 
Of Curiosity 
Of subjects that resist 
Redoubtablest is this 
Where go we Go 
we anywhere 
Creation after this? 
How Lonesome The Wind Must Feel Nights 
How lonesome the Wind must feel Nights When 
people have put out the Lights 
And everything that has an Inn 
Closes the shutter and goes in 
How pompous the Wind must feel Noons 
Stepping to incorporeal Tunes 
Correcting errors of the sky 
And clarifying scenery 
How mighty the Wind must feel Morns 
Encamping on a thousand dawns 
Espousing each and spurning all 
Then soaring to his Temple Tall 
How Many Flowers Fail In Wood 
 
How many Flowers fail in Wood&mdash; 
Or perish from the Hill&mdash; 
Without the privilege to know 
That they are Beautiful&mdash; 
How many cast a nameless Pod

Unconscious of the Scarlet Freight&mdash; 
It bear to Other Eyes&mdash; 
How Many Times These Low Feet Staggered 
 
How many times these low feet staggered&mdash; 
Only the soldered mouth can tell&mdash; 
Try&mdash;can you stir the awful rivet&mdash; 
Try&mdash;can you lift the hasps of steel! 
Stroke the cool forehead&mdash;hot so often&mdash; 
Lift&mdash;if you care&mdash;the listless hair&mdash; 
Handle the adamantine fingers 
Never a thimble&mdash;more&mdash;shall wear&mdash; 
Buzz the dull flies&mdash;on the chamber window&mdash; 
Brave&mdash;shines the sun through the freckled pane&mdash; 
Fearless&mdash;the cobweb swings from the ceiling&mdash; 
Indolent Housewife&mdash;in Daisies&mdash;lain! 
How Noteless Men, And Pleiads, Stand 
 
How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand, 
Until a sudden sky 
Reveals the fact that One is rapt 
Forever from the Eye&mdash; 
Members of the Invisible, 
Existing, while we stare, 
In Leagueless Opportunity, 
O'ertakenless, as the Air&mdash; 
Why didn't we detain Them? 
The Heavens with a smile, 
Sweep by our disappointed Heads 
Without a syllable&mdash; 
How Sick—to Wait—in Any Place—but Thine 
 
How sick—to wait—in any place—but thine— 
I knew last night—when someone tried to twine— 
Thinking—perhaps—that I looked tired—or alone— 
Or breaking—almost—with unspoken pain— 
And I turned—ducal— 
That right—was thine— 
One port—suffices—for a Brig—like mine— 
Ours be the tossing—wild though the sea— 
Rather than a Mooring—unshared by thee. 
Ours be the Cargo—unladed—here— 
Rather than the "spicy isles—" 
And thou—not there— 
How Slow The Wind 
How slow the Wind how 
slow the sea how

How The Old Mountains Drip With Sunset 
 
How the old Mountains drip with Sunset 
How the Hemlocks burn&mdash; 
How the Dun Brake is draped in Cinder

How the old Steeples hand the Scarlet 
Till the Ball is full&mdash; 
Have I the lip of the Flamingo 
That I dare to tell? 
Then, how the Fire ebbs like Billows&mdash; 
Touching all the Grass 
With a departing&mdash;Sapphire&mdash;feature&mdash; 
As a Duchess passed&mdash; 
How a small Dusk crawls on the Village 
Till the Houses blot 
And the odd Flambeau, no men carry 
Glimmer on the Street&mdash; 
How it is Night&mdash;in Nest and Kennel&mdash; 
And where was the Wood&mdash; 
Just a Dome of Abyss is Bowing 
Into Solitude&mdash;

I am afraid to own a Body 
I am afraid to own a Body I

Double Estate -entailed at pleasure 
Upon an unsuspecting Heir Duke 
in a moment of Deathlessness 
And God, for a Frontier. 
I Am Alive - I Guess 
I am alive—I guess— 
The Branches on my Hand 
Are full of Morning Glory— 
And at my finger's end— 
The Carmine—tingles warm— 
And if I hold a Glass 
Across my Mouth—it blurs it— 
Physician's—proof of Breath— 
I am alive—because 
I am not in a Room— 
The Parlor—Commonly—it is— 
So Visitors may come— 
And lean—and view it sidewise— 
And add 'How cold—it grew'— 
And 'Was it conscious—when it stepped 
In Immortality? ' 
I am alive—because 
I do not own a House— 
Entitled to myself—precise— 
And fitting no one else— 
And marked my Girlhood's name— 
So Visitors may know 
Which Door is mine—and not 
I Am Ashamed—i Hide 
 
I am ashamed—I hide— 
What right have I—to be a Bride— 
So late a Dowerless Girl— 
Nowhere to hide my dazzled Face— 
No one to teach me that new Grace— 
Nor introduce—my Soul— 
Me to adorn—How—tell— 
Trinket—to make Me beautiful— 
Fabrics of Cashmere— 
Never a Gown of Dun—more— 
Raiment instead—of Pompadour— 
For Me—My soul—to wear— 
Fingers—to frame my Round Hair 
Oval—as Feudal Ladies wore— 
Far Fashions—Fair— 
Skill to hold my Brow like an Earl— 
Plead—like a Whippoorwill— 
Prove—like a Pearl— 
Then, for Character— 
Fashion My Spirit quaint—white— 
Quick—like a Liquor— 
Gay—like Light— 
Bring Me my best Pride— 
No more ashamed— 
No more to hide— 
Meek—let it be—too proud—for Pride— 
Baptized—this Day—a Bride— 
I Asked No Other Thing 
 
I asked no other thing&mdash; 
No other&mdash;was denied&mdash; 
I offered Being&mdash;for it&mdash; 
The Mighty Merchant sneered&mdash; 
Brazil? He twirled a Button&mdash; 
Without a glance my way&mdash; 
"But&mdash;Madam&mdash;is there nothing else&mdash; 
That We can show&mdash;Today?" 
I Bet With Every Wind That Blew 
I bet with every Wind that blew 
Till Nature in chagrin 
Employed a Fact to visit me 
And scuttle my Balloon 
I Breathed Enough To Learn The Trick, 
I breathed enough to learn the trick, 
And now, removed from air, 
I simulate the breath so well, 
That one, to be quite sure 
The lungs are stirless, must descend 
Among the cunning cells, 
And touch the pantomime himself. 
How cool the bellows feels! 
I Bring An Unaccustomed Wine 
 
I bring an unaccustomed wine 
To lips long parching 
Next to mine, 
And summon them to drink; 
Crackling with fever, they Essay, 
I turn my brimming eyes away, 
And come next hour to look. 
The hands still hug the tardy glass&mdash; 
The lips I would have cooled, alas&mdash; 
Are so superfluous Cold&mdash; 
I would as soon attempt to warm 
The bosoms where the frost has lain 
Ages beneath the mould&mdash; 
Some other thirsty there may be 
To whom this would have pointed me 
Had it remained to speak&mdash; 
And so I always bear the cup 
If, haply, mine may be the drop 
Some pilgrim thirst to slake&mdash; 
If, haply, any say to me 
"Unto the little, unto me," 
When I at last awake. 
I Came To Buy A Smile—today 
 
I Came to buy a smile—today— 
But just a single smile— 
The smallest one upon your face 
Will suit me just as well— 
The one that no one else would miss 
It shone so very small— 
I'm pleading at the "counter"—sir— 
Could you afford to sell— 
I've Diamonds—on my fingers— 
You know what Diamonds are? 
I've Rubies—live the Evening Blood— 
And Topaz—like the star! 
'Twould be "a Bargain" for a Jew! 
Say—may I have it—Sir? 
I Can Wade Grief 
 
I can wade Grief&mdash; 
Whole Pools of it&mdash; 
I'm used to that&mdash; 
But the least push of Joy 
Breaks up my feet&mdash; 
And I tip&mdash;drunken&mdash; 
Let no Pebble&mdash;smile&mdash; 
'Twas the New Liquor&mdash; 
That was all! 
Power is only Pain&mdash; 
Stranded, thro' Discipline, 
Till Weights&mdash;will hang&mdash; 
Give Balm&mdash;to Giants&mdash; 
And they'll wilt, like Men&mdash; 
Give Himmaleh&mdash; 
They'll Carry&mdash;Him! 
I Cannot Be Ashamed 
 
I cannot be ashamed 
Because I cannot see 
The love you offer&mdash; 
Magnitude 
Reverses Modesty 
And I cannot be proud 
Because a Height so high 
Involves Alpine 
Requirements 
And Services of Snow. 
I Cannot Buy It—'Tis Not Sold 
 
I cannot buy it—'tis not sold— 
There is no other in the World— 
Mine was the only one 
I was so happy I forgot 
To shut the Door And it went out 
And I am all alone— 
If I could find it Anywhere 
I would not mind the journey there 
Though it took all my store 
But just to look it in the Eye— 
"Did'st thou?" "Thou did'st not mean," to say, 
Then, turn my Face away. 
I Cannot Dance Upon My Toes 
 
I cannot dance upon my Toes— 
No Man instructed me— 
But oftentimes, among my mind, 
A Glee possesseth me, 
That had I Ballet knowledge— 
Would put itself abroad 
In Pirouette to blanch a Troupe— 
Or lay a Prima, mad, 
And though I had no Gown of Gauze— 
No Ringlet, to my Hair, 
Nor hopped to Audiences—like Birds, 
One Claw upon the Air, 
Nor tossed my shape in Eider Balls, 
Nor rolled on wheels of snow 
Till I was out of sight, in sound, 
The House encore me so— 
Nor any know I know the Art 
I mention—easy—Here— 
Nor any Placard boast me— 
It's full as Opera— 
I Cannot Live With You (No. 640) 
I cannot live with You-It 
would be Life-And 
Life is over there-Behind 
the Shelf 
The Sexton keeps the Key to-Putting 
up 
Our Life--His Porcelain-Like 
a Cup-
Discarded of the Housewife-Quaint--
or Broke-A 
newer Sevres pleases-Old 
Ones crack-
I could not die--with You-For 
One must wait 
To shut the Other's Gaze down-You--
could not-
And I--could I stand by 
And see You--freeze-Without 
my Right of Frost-Death's 
privilege? 
Nor could I rise--with You-Because 
Your Face 
Would put out Jesus'-That 
New Grace 
Glow plain--and foreign 
On my homesick Eye-Except 
that You than He 
Shone closer by-
They'd judge Us--How-For 
You--served Heaven--You know, 
Or sought to-I 
could not-
Because You saturated Sight-And 
I had no more Eyes 
For sordid excellence 
As Paradise 
And were You lost, I would be-Though 
My Name 
Rang loudest 
On the Heavenly fame-
And were You--saved-And 
I--condemned to be 
Where You were not-That 
self--were Hell to Me-
So We must meet apart-You 
there--I--here-With 
just the Door ajar 
That Oceans are--and Prayer-And 
that White Sustenance-Despair-
I Can'T Tell You—but You Feel It 
 
I can't tell you—but you feel it— 
Nor can you tell me— 
Saints, with ravished slate and pencil 
Solve our April Day! 
Sweeter than a vanished frolic 
From a vanished green! 
Swifter than the hoofs of Horsemen 
Round a Ledge of dream! 
Modest, let us walk among it 
With our faces veiled— 
As they say polite Archangels 
Do in meeting God! 
Not for me—to prate about it! 
Not for you—to say 
To some fashionable Lady 
"Charming April Day"! 
Rather—Heaven's "Peter Parley"! 
By which Children slow 
To sublimer Recitation 
Are prepared to go! 
I Cautious, Scanned My Little Life 
 
I cautious, scanned my little life&mdash; 
I winnowed what would fade 
From what would last till Heads like mine 
Should be a-dreaming laid. 
I put the latter in a Barn&mdash; 
The former, blew away. 
I went one winter morning 
And lo - my priceless Hay 
Was not upon the "Scaffold"&mdash; 
Was not upon the "Beam"&mdash; 
And from a thriving Farmer&mdash; 
A Cynic, I became. 
Whether a Thief did it&mdash; 
Whether it was the wind&mdash; 
Whether Deity's guiltless&mdash; 
My business is, to find! 
So I begin to ransack! 
How is it Hearts, with Thee? 
Art thou within the little Barn 
Love provided Thee? 
I Could Bring You Jewels—had I A Mind To 
 
I could bring You Jewels—had I a mind to— 
But You have enough—of those— 
I could bring You Odors from St. Domingo— 
Colors—from Vera Cruz— 
Berries of the Bahamas—have I— 
But this little Blaze 
Flickering to itself—in the Meadow— 
Suits Me—more than those— 
Never a Fellow matched this Topaz— 
And his Emerald Swing— 
Dower itself—for Bobadilo— 
Better—Could I bring? 
I Could Die—to Know 
 
I could die—to know— 
'Tis a trifling knowledge— 
News-Boys salute the Door— 
Carts—joggle by— 
Morning's bold face—stares in the window— 
Were but mine—the Charter of the least Fly— 
Houses hunch the House 
With their Brick Shoulders— 
Coals—from a Rolling Load—rattle—how—near— 
To the very Square—His foot is passing— 
Possibly, this moment— 
While I—dream—Here— 
I Could Not Drink It, Sweet 
 
I could not drink it, Sweet, 
Till You had tasted first, 
Though cooler than the Water was 
The Thoughtfullness of Thirst. 
I Could Not Prove The Years Had Feet 
 
I could not prove the Years had feet&mdash; 
Yet confident they run 
Am I, from symptoms that are past 
And Series that are done&mdash; 
I find my feet have further Goals&mdash; 
I smile upon the Aims 
That felt so ample&mdash;Yesterday&mdash; 
Today's&mdash;have vaster claims&mdash; 
I do not doubt the self I was 
Was competent to me&mdash; 
But something awkward in the fit&mdash; 
Proves that&mdash;outgrown&mdash;I see&mdash; 
I Could Suffice For Him, I Knew 
 
I could suffice for Him, I knew&mdash; 
He&mdash;could suffice for Me&mdash; 
Yet Hesitating Fractions&mdash;Both 
Surveyed Infinity&mdash; 
"Would I be Whole" He sudden broached&mdash; 
My syllable rebelled&mdash; 
'Twas face to face with Nature&mdash;forced&mdash; 
'Twas face to face with God&mdash; 
Withdrew the Sun&mdash;to Other Wests&mdash; 
Withdrew the furthest Star 
Before Decision&mdash;stooped to speech&mdash; 
And then&mdash;be audibler 
The Answer of the Sea unto 
The Motion of the Moon&mdash; 
Herself adjust Her Tides&mdash;unto&mdash; 
Could I&mdash;do else&mdash;with Mine? 
I Cried At Pity—not At Pain 
 
I cried at Pity—not at Pain— 
I heard a Woman say 
"Poor Child"—and something in her voice 
Convicted me—of me— 
So long I fainted, to myself 
It seemed the common way, 
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things— 
To look at, like a Toy— 
To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy 
And see the Parcel rolled— 
And carried, I supposed—to Heaven, 
For children, made of Gold— 
But not to touch, or wish for, 
Or think of, with a sigh— 
And so and so—had been to me, 
Had God willed differently. 
I wish I knew that Woman's name— 
So when she comes this way, 
To hold my life, and hold my ears 
For fear I hear her say 
She's "sorry I am dead"—again— 
Just when the Grave and I— 
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep, 
Our only Lullaby— 
I Cross Till I Am Weary 
 
I cross till I am weary 
A Mountain&mdash;in my mind&mdash; 
More Mountains&mdash;then a Sea&mdash; 
More Seas&mdash;And then 
A Desert&mdash;find&mdash; 
And My Horizon blocks 
With steady&mdash;drifting&mdash;Grains 
Of unconjectured quantity&mdash; 
As Asiatic Rains&mdash; 
Nor this&mdash;defeat my Pace&mdash; 
It hinder from the West 
But as an Enemy's Salute 
One hurrying to Rest&mdash; 
What merit had the Goal&mdash; 
Except there intervene 
Faint Doubt&mdash;and far Competitor&mdash; 
To jeopardize the Gain? 
At last&mdash;the Grace in sight&mdash; 
I shout unto my feet&mdash; 
I offer them the Whole of Heaven 
The instant that we meet&mdash; 
They strive&mdash;and yet delay&mdash; 
They perish&mdash;Do we die&mdash; 
Or is this Death's Experiment&mdash; 
Reversed&mdash;in Victory? 
I Died For Beauty 
I died for beauty, but was scarce 
Adjusted in the tomb, 
When one who died for truth was lain 
In an adjoining room. 
He questioned softly why I failed? 
"For beauty," I replied. 
"And I for truth - the two are one; 
We brethren are," he said. 
And so, as kinsmen met a-night, 
We talked between the rooms, 
Until the moss had reached our lips, 
And covered up our names. 
I Died For Beauty But Was Scarce 
I died for beauty but was scarce 
Adjusted in the tomb, 
When one who died for truth was lain 
In an adjoining room. 
He questioned softly why I failed? 
'For beauty,' I replied. 
'And I for truth,--the two are one; 
We brethren are,' he said. 
And so, as kinsmen met a night, 
We talked between the rooms, 
Until the moss had reached our lips, 
And covered up our names. 
I Dreaded That First Robin, So 
 
I dreaded that first Robin, so, 
But He is mastered, now, 
I'm accustomed to Him grown, 
He hurts a little, though&mdash; 
I thought If I could only live 
Till that first Shout got by&mdash; 
Not all Pianos in the Woods 
Had power to mangle me&mdash; 
I dared not meet the Daffodils&mdash; 
For fear their Yellow Gown 
Would pierce me with a fashion 
So foreign to my own&mdash; 
I wished the Grass would hurry&mdash; 
So&mdash;when 'twas time to see&mdash; 
He'd be too tall, the tallest one 
Could stretch&mdash;to look at me&mdash; 
I could not bear the Bees should come, 
I wished they'd stay away 
In those dim countries where they go, 
What word had they, for me? 
They're here, though; not a creature failed&mdash; 
No Blossom stayed away 
In gentle deference to me&mdash; 
The Queen of Calvary&mdash; 
Each one salutes me, as he goes, 
And I, my childish Plumes, 
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment 
Of their unthinking Drums&mdash; 
I Dwell In Possibility 
 
I dwell in Possibility&mdash; 
A fairer House than Prose&mdash; 
More numerous of Windows&mdash; 
Superior&mdash;for Doors&mdash; 
Of Chambers as the Cedars&mdash; 
Impregnable of Eye&mdash; 
And for an Everlasting Roof 
The Gambrels of the Sky&mdash; 
Of Visitors&mdash;the fairest&mdash; 
For Occupation&mdash;This&mdash; 
The spreading wide of narrow Hands 
To gather Paradise&mdash; 
I Envy Seas, Whereon He Rides 
 
I envy Seas, whereon He rides&mdash; 
I envy Spokes of Wheels 
Of Chariots, that Him convey&mdash; 
I envy Crooked Hills 
That gaze upon His journey&mdash; 
How easy All can see 
What is forbidden utterly 
As Heaven&mdash;unto me! 
I envy Nests of Sparrows&mdash; 
That dot His distant Eaves&mdash; 
The wealthy Fly, upon His Pane&mdash; 
The happy&mdash;happy Leaves&mdash; 
That just abroad His Window 
Have Summer's leave to play&mdash; 
The Ear Rings of Pizarro 
Could not obtain for me&mdash; 
I envy Light&mdash;that wakes Him&mdash; 
And Bells&mdash;that boldly ring 
To tell Him it is Noon, abroad&mdash; 
Myself&mdash;be Noon to Him&mdash; 
Yet interdict&mdash;my Blossom&mdash; 
And abrogate&mdash;my Bee&mdash; 
Lest Noon in Everlasting Night&mdash; 
Drop Gabriel&mdash;and Me&mdash; 
I Fear A Man Of Frugal Speech 
 
I fear a Man of frugal Speech&mdash; 
I fear a Silent Man&mdash; 
Haranguer&mdash;I can overtake&mdash; 
Or Babbler&mdash;entertain&mdash; 
But He who weigheth&mdash;While the Rest&mdash; 
Expend their furthest pound&mdash; 
Of this Man&mdash;I am wary&mdash; 
I fear that He is Grand&mdash; 
I Felt A Cleaving In My Mind 
I felt a cleaving in my mind 
As if my brain had split; 
I tried to match it, seam by seam, 
But could not make them fit. 
The thought behind I strove to join 
Unto the thought before, 
But sequence ravelled out of reach 
Like balls upon a floor. 
I Felt A Funeral, In My Brain (280) 
I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, 
And Mourners to and fro 
Kept treading--treading--till it seemed 
That Sense was breaking through-
And when they all were seated, 
A Service, like a Drum-Kept 
beating--beating--till I thought 
My Mind was going numb-
And then I heard them lift a Box 
And creak across my Soul 
With those same Boots of Lead, again, 
Then Space--began to toll, 
As all the Heavens were a Bell, 
And Being, but an Ear, 
And I, and Silence, some strange Race 
Wrecked, solitary, here-
And then a Plank in Reason, broke, 
And I dropped down, and down-And 
hit a World, at every plunge, 
And Finished knowing--then-
I Felt My Life With Both My Hands 
 
I felt my life with both my hands 
To see if it was there&mdash; 
I held my spirit to the Glass, 
To prove it possibler&mdash; 
I turned my Being round and round 
And paused at every pound 
To ask the Owner's name&mdash; 
For doubt, that I should know the Sound&mdash; 
I judged my features&mdash;jarred my hair&mdash; 
I pushed my dimples by, and waited&mdash; 
If they&mdash;twinkled back&mdash; 
Conviction might, of me&mdash; 
I told myself, "Take Courage, Friend&mdash; 
That&mdash;was a former time&mdash; 
But we might learn to like the Heaven, 
As well as our Old Home!" 
I Found The Phrase To Every Thought 
I found the phrase to every thought 
I ever had, but one; 
And that defies me,--as a hand 
Did try to chalk the sun 
To races nurtured in the dark;-How 
would your own begin? 
Can blaze be done in cochineal, 
Or noon in mazarin? 
I Gained It So 
 
I gained it so&mdash; 
By Climbing slow&mdash; 
By Catching at the Twigs that grow 
Between the Bliss&mdash;and me&mdash; 
It hung so high 
As well the Sky 
Attempt by Strategy&mdash; 
I said I gained it&mdash; 
This&mdash;was all&mdash; 
Look, how I clutch it 
Lest it fall&mdash; 
And I a Pauper go&mdash; 
Unfitted by an instant's Grace 
For the Contented&mdash;Beggar's face 
I wore&mdash;an hour ago&mdash; 
I Gave Myself To Him 
 
I gave myself to Him&mdash; 
And took Himself, for Pay, 
The solemn contract of a Life 
Was ratified, this way&mdash; 
The Wealth might disappoint&mdash; 
Myself a poorer prove 
Than this great Purchaser suspect, 
The Daily Own&mdash;of Love 
Depreciate the Vision&mdash; 
But till the Merchant buy&mdash; 
Still Fable&mdash;in the Isles of Spice&mdash; 
The subtle Cargoes&mdash;lie&mdash; 
At least&mdash;'tis Mutual&mdash;Risk&mdash; 
Some&mdash;found it&mdash;Mutual Gain&mdash; 
Sweet Debt of Life&mdash;Each Night to owe&mdash; 
Insolvent&mdash;every Noon&mdash; 
I Got So I Could Take His Name 
 
I got so I could take his name&mdash; 
Without&mdash;Tremendous gain&mdash; 
That Stop-sensation&mdash;on my Soul&mdash; 
And Thunder&mdash;in the Room&mdash; 
I got so I could walk across 
That Angle in the floor, 
Where he turned so, and I turned&mdash;how&mdash; 
And all our Sinew tore&mdash; 
I got so I could stir the Box&mdash; 
In which his letters grew 
Without that forcing, in my breath&mdash; 
As Staples&mdash;driven through&mdash; 
Could dimly recollect a Grace&mdash; 
I think, they call it "God"&mdash; 
Renowned to ease Extremity&mdash; 
When Formula, had failed&mdash; 
And shape my Hands&mdash; 
Petition's way, 
Tho' ignorant of a word 
That Ordination&mdash;utters&mdash; 
My Business, with the Cloud, 
If any Power behind it, be, 
Not subject to Despair&mdash; 
It care, in some remoter way, 
For so minute affair 
As Misery&mdash; 
Itself, too vast, for interrupting&mdash;more&mdash; 
I Had A Guinea Golden 
 
I had a guinea golden&mdash; 
I lost it in the sand&mdash; 
And tho' the sum was simple 
And pounds were in the land&mdash; 
Still, had it such a value 
Unto my frugal eye&mdash; 
That when I could not find it&mdash; 
I sat me down to sigh. 
I had a crimson Robin&mdash; 
Who sang full many a day 
But when the woods were painted, 
He, too, did fly away&mdash; 
Time brought me other Robins&mdash; 
Their ballads were the same&mdash; 
Still, for my missing Troubador 
I kept the "house at hame." 
I had a star in heaven&mdash; 
One "Pleiad" was its name&mdash; 
And when I was not heeding, 
It wandered from the same. 
And tho' the skies are crowded&mdash; 
And all the night ashine&mdash; 
I do not care about it&mdash; 
Since none of them are mine. 
My story has a moral&mdash; 
I have a missing friend&mdash; 
"Pleiad" its name, and Robin, 
And guinea in the sand. 
And when this mournful ditty 
Accompanied with tear&mdash; 
Shall meet the eye of traitor 
In country far from here&mdash; 
Grant that repentance solemn 
May seize upon his mind&mdash; 
And he no consolation 
Beneath the sun may find. 
I Had Been Hungry All The Years-
I had been hungry all the years-
My noon had come, to dine-
I, trembling, drew the table near 
And touched the curious wine. 
'T was this on tables I had seen 
When turning, hungry, lone, 
I looked in windows, for the wealth 
I could not hope to own. 
I did not know the ample bread, 
'T was so unlike the crumb 
The birds and I had often shared 
In Nature's dining-room. 
The plenty hurt me, 't was so new,-Myself 
felt ill and odd, 
As berry of a mountain bush 
Transplanted to the road. 
Nor was I hungry; so I found 
That hunger was a way 
Of persons outside windows, 
The entering takes away. 
I Had No Cause To Be Awake 
 
I had no Cause to be awake&mdash; 
My Best&mdash;was gone to sleep&mdash; 
And Morn a new politeness took&mdash; 
And failed to wake them up&mdash; 
But called the others&mdash;clear&mdash; 
And passed their Curtains by&mdash; 
Sweet Morning&mdash;when I oversleep&mdash; 
Knock&mdash;Recollect&mdash;to Me&mdash; 
I looked at Sunrise&mdash;Once&mdash; 
And then I looked at Them&mdash; 
And wishfulness in me arose&mdash; 
For Circumstance the same&mdash; 
'Twas such an Ample Peace&mdash; 
It could not hold a Sigh&mdash; 
'Twas Sabbath&mdash;with the Bells divorced&mdash; 
'Twas Sunset&mdash;all the Day&mdash; 
So choosing but a Gown&mdash; 
And taking but a Prayer&mdash; 
The only Raiment I should need&mdash; 
I struggled&mdash;and was There&mdash; 
I Had No Time To Hate, Because 
I had no time to hate, because 
The grave would hinder me, 
And life was not so ample I 
Could finish enmity. 
Nor had I time to love, but since 
Some industry must be, 
The little toil of love, I thought, 
Was large enough for me. 
I Had Not Minded—walls 
 
I had not minded—Walls— 
Were Universe—one Rock— 
And fr I heard his silver Call 
The other side the Block— 
I'd tunnel—till my Groove 
Pushed sudden thro' to his— 
Then my face take her Recompense— 
The looking in his Eyes— 
But 'tis a single Hair— 
A filament—a law— 
A Cobweb—wove in Adamant— 
A Battlement—of Straw— 
A limit like the Veil 
Unto the Lady's face— 
But every Mesh—a Citadel— 
And Dragons—in the Crease— 
I Had Some Things That I Called Mine 
 
I had some things that I called mine&mdash; 
And God, that he called his, 
Till, recently a rival Claim 
Disturbed these amities. 
The property, my garden, 
Which having sown with care, 
He claims the pretty acre, 
And sends a Bailiff there. 
The station of the parties 
Forbids publicity, 
But Justice is sublimer 
Than arms, or pedigree. 
I'll institute an "Action"&mdash; 
I'll vindicate the law&mdash; 
Jove! Choose your counsel&mdash; 
I retain "Shaw"! 
I Had The Glory—that Will Do 
 
I had the Glory—that will do— 
An Honor, Thought can turn her to 
When lesser Fames invite— 
With one long "Nay"— 
Bliss' early shape 
Deforming—Dwindling—Gulfing up— 
Time's possibility. 
I Have A Bird In Spring 
 
I have a Bird in spring 
Which for myself doth sing&mdash; 
The spring decoys. 
And as the summer nears&mdash; 
And as the Rose appears, 
Robin is gone. 
Yet do I not repine 
Knowing that Bird of mine 
Though flown&mdash; 
Learneth beyond the sea 
Melody new for me 
And will return. 
Fast is a safer hand 
Held in a truer Land 
Are mine&mdash; 
And though they now depart, 
Tell I my doubting heart 
They're thine. 
In a serener Bright, 
In a more golden light 
I see 
Each little doubt and fear, 
Each little discord here 
Removed. 
Then will I not repine, 
Knowing that Bird of mine 
Though flown 
Shall in a distant tree 
Bright melody for me 
Return. 
I Have A King, Who Does Not Speak 
 
I have a King, who does not speak&mdash; 
So&mdash;wondering&mdash;thro' the hours meek 
I trudge the day away&mdash; 
Half glad when it is night, and sleep, 
If, haply, thro' a dream, to peep 
In parlors, shut by day. 
And if I do&mdash;when morning comes&mdash; 
It is as if a hundred drums 
Did round my pillow roll, 
And shouts fill all my Childish sky, 
And Bells keep saying "Victory" 
From steeples in my soul! 
And if I don't&mdash;the little Bird 
Within the Orchard, is not heard, 
And I omit to pray 
"Father, thy will be done" today 
For my will goes the other way, 
And it were perjury! 
I Have Never Seen "Volcanoes" 
 
I have never seen "Volcanoes"&mdash; 
But, when Travellers tell 
How those old&mdash;phlegmatic mountains 
Usually so still&mdash; 
Bear within&mdash;appalling Ordnance, 
Fire, and smoke, and gun, 
Taking Villages for breakfast, 
And appalling Men&mdash; 
If the stillness is Volcanic 
In the human face 
When upon a pain Titanic 
Features keep their place&mdash; 
If at length the smouldering anguish 
Will not overcome&mdash; 
And the palpitating Vineyard 
In the dust, be thrown? 
If some loving Antiquary, 
On Resumption Morn, 
Will not cry with joy "Pompeii"! 
To the Hills return! 
I Have No Life But This 
I have no life but this, 
To lead it here; 
Nor any death, but lest 
Dispelled from there; 
Nor tie to earths to come, 
Nor action new, 
Except through this extent, 
The Realm of You! 
I Haven'T Told My Garden Yet 
 
I haven't told my garden yet&mdash; 
Lest that should conquer me. 
I haven't quite the strength now 
To break it to the Bee&mdash; 
I will not name it in the street 
For shops would stare at me&mdash; 
That one so shy&mdash;so ignorant 
Should have the face to die. 
The hillsides must not know it&mdash; 
Where I have rambled so&mdash; 
Nor tell the loving forests 
The day that I shall go&mdash; 
Nor lisp it at the table&mdash; 
Nor heedless by the way 
Hint that within the Riddle 
One will walk today&mdash; 
I Heard A Fly Buzz When I Died; 
I heard a fly buzz when I died; 
The stillness round my form 
Was like the stillness in the air 
Between the heaves of storm. 
The eyes beside had wrung them dry, 
And breaths were gathering sure 
For that last onset, when the king 
Be witnessed in his power. 
I willed my keepsakes, signed away 
What portion of me I 
Could make assignable,--and then 
There interposed a fly, 
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz, 
Between the light and me; 
And then the windows failed, and then 
I could not see to see. 
I Held A Jewel In My Fingers 
I held a Jewel in my fingers— 
And went to sleep— 
The day was warm, and winds were prosy— 
I said ''Twill keep'— 
I woke—and chid my honest fingers, 
The Gem was gone— 
And now, an Amethyst remembrance 
Is all I own— 
I Hide Myself Within My Flower 
 
I hide myself within my flower, 
That fading from your Vase, 
You, unsuspecting, feel for me&mdash; 
Almost a loneliness. 
I Keep My Pledge 
 
I keep my pledge. 
I was not called&mdash; 
Death did not notice me. 
I bring my Rose. 
I plight again, 
By every sainted Bee&mdash; 
By Daisy called from hillside&mdash; 
by Bobolink from lane. 
Blossom and I&mdash; 
Her oath, and mine&mdash; 
Will surely come again. 
I Know A Place Where Summer Strives 
I know a place where summer strives 
With such a practised frost, 
She each year leads her daisies back, 
Recording briefly, 'Lost.' 
But when the south wind stirs the pools 
And struggles in the lanes, 
Her heart misgives her for her vow, 
And she pours soft refrains 
Into the lap of adamant, 
And spices, and the dew, 
That stiffens quietly to quartz 
Upon her amber shoe. 
I Know Lives, I Could Miss 
 
I know lives, I could miss 
Without a Misery&mdash; 
Others&mdash;whose instant's wanting&mdash; 
Would be Eternity&mdash; 
The last&mdash;a scanty Number&mdash; 
'Twould scarcely fill a Two&mdash; 
The first&mdash;a Gnat's Horizon 
Could easily outgrow&mdash; 
I Know Some Lonely Houses Off The Road 
 
I know some lonely Houses off the Road 
A Robber'd like the look of&mdash; 
Wooden barred, 
And Windows hanging low, 
Inviting to&mdash; 
A Portico, 
Where two could creep&mdash; 
One&mdash;hand the Tools&mdash; 
The other peep&mdash; 
To make sure All's Asleep&mdash; 
Old fashioned eyes&mdash; 
Not easy to surprise! 
How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night, 
With just a Clock&mdash; 
But they could gag the Tick&mdash; 
And Mice won't bark&mdash; 
And so the Walls&mdash;don't tell&mdash; 
None&mdash;will&mdash; 
A pair of Spectacles ajar just stir&mdash; 
An Almanac's aware&mdash; 
Was it the Mat&mdash;winked, 
Or a Nervous Star? 
The Moon&mdash;slides down the stair, 
To see who's there! 
There's plunder&mdash;where&mdash; 
Tankard, or Spoon&mdash; 
Earring&mdash;or Stone&mdash; 
A Watch&mdash;Some Ancient Brooch 
To match the Grandmama&mdash; 
Staid sleeping&mdash;there&mdash; 
Day&mdash;rattles&mdash;too 
Stealth's&mdash;slow&mdash; 
The Sun has got as far 
As the third Sycamore&mdash; 
Screams Chanticleer 
"Who's there"? 
And Echoes&mdash;Trains away, 
Sneer&mdash;"Where"! 
While the old Couple, just astir, 
Fancy the Sunrise&mdash;left the door ajar! 
I Know That He Exists 
 
I know that He exists. 
Somewhere&mdash;in Silence&mdash; 
He has hid his rare life 
From our gross eyes. 
'Tis an instant's play. 
'Tis a fond Ambush&mdash; 
Just to make Bliss 
Earn her own surprise! 
But&mdash;should the play 
Prove piercing earnest&mdash; 
Should the glee&mdash;glaze&mdash; 
In Death's&mdash;stiff&mdash;stare&mdash; 
Would not the fun 
Look too expensive! 
Would not the jest&mdash; 
Have crawled too far! 
I Know Where Wells Grow—droughtless Wells 
 
I know where Wells grow—Droughtless Wells— 
Deep dug—for Summer days— 
Where Mosses go no more away— 
And Pebble—safely plays— 
It's made of Fathoms—and a Belt— 
A Belt of jagged Stone— 
Inlaid with Emerald—half way down— 
And Diamonds—jumbled on— 
It has no Bucket—Were I rich 
A Bucket I would buy— 
I'm often thirsty—but my lips 
Are so high up—You see— 
I read in an Old fashioned Book 
That People "thirst no more"— 
The Wells have Buckets to them there— 
It must mean that—I'm sure— 
Shall We remember Parching—then? 
Those Waters sound so grand— 
I think a little Well—like Mine— 
Dearer to understand— 
I Learned—at Least—what Home Could Be 
 
I learned—at least—what Home could be— 
How ignorant I had been 
Of pretty ways of Covenant— 
How awkward at the Hymn 
Round our new Fireside—but for this— 
This pattern—of the Way— 
Whose Memory drowns me, like the Dip 
Of a Celestial Sea— 
What Mornings in our Garden—guessed— 
What Bees—for us—to hum— 
With only Birds to interrupt 
The Ripple of our Theme— 
And Task for Both— 
When Play be done— 
Your Problem—of the Brain— 
And mine—some foolisher effect— 
A Ruffle—or a Tune— 
The Afternoons—Together spent— 
And Twilight—in the Lanes— 
Some ministry to poorer lives— 
Seen poorest—thro' our gains— 
And then Return—and Night—and Home— 
And then away to You to pass— 
A new—diviner—care— 
Till Sunrise take us back to Scene— 
Transmuted—Vivider— 
This seems a Home— 
And Home is not— 
But what that Place could be— 
Afflicts me—as a Setting Sun— 
Where Dawn—knows how to be— 
I Like A Look Of Agony 
 
I like a look of Agony, 
Because I know it's true&mdash; 
Men do not sham Convulsion, 
Nor simulate, a Throe&mdash; 
The Eyes glaze once&mdash;and that is Death&mdash; 
Impossible to feign 
The Beads upon the Forehead 
By homely Anguish strung. 
I Like To See It Lap The Miles, 
I like to see it lap the miles, 
And lick the valleys up, 
And stop to feed itself at tanks; 
And then, prodigious, step 
Around a pile of mountains, 
And, supercilious, peer 
In shanties by the sides of roads; 
And then a quarry pare 
To fit its sides, and crawl between, 
Complaining all the while 
In horrid, hooting stanza; 
Then chase itself down hill 
And neigh like Boanerges; 
Then, punctual as a star, 
Stop--docile and omnipotent-At 
its own stable door. 
I Live With Him—i See His Face 
 
I live with Him—I see His face— 
I go no more away 
For Visitor—or Sundown— 
Death's single privacy 
The Only One—forestalling Mine— 
And that—by Right that He 
Presents a Claim invisible— 
No wedlock—granted Me— 
I live with Him—I hear His Voice— 
I stand alive—Today— 
To witness to the Certainty 
Of Immortality— 
Taught Me—by Time—the lower Way— 
Conviction—Every day— 
That Life like This—is stopless— 
Be Judgment—what it may— 
I Lived On Dread 
 
I lived on Dread&mdash; 
To Those who know 
The Stimulus there is 
In Danger&mdash;Other impetus 
Is numb&mdash;and Vitalless&mdash; 
As 'twere a Spur&mdash;upon the Soul&mdash; 
A Fear will urge it where 
To go without the Sceptre's aid 
Were Challenging Despair. 
I Lived On Dread; To Those Who Know 
I lived on dread; to those who know 
The stimulus there is 
In danger, other impetus 
Is numb and vital-less. 
As't were a spur upon the soul, 
A fear will urge it where 
To go without the spectre's aid 
Were challenging despair. 
I Lost A World - The Other Day! 
 
I lost a World - the other day! 
Has Anybody found? 
You'll know it by the Row of Stars 
Around its forehead bound. 
A Rich man&mdash;might not notice it&mdash; 
Yet&mdash;to my frugal Eye, 
Of more Esteem than Ducats&mdash; 
Oh find it&mdash;Sir&mdash;for me! 
I Made Slow Riches But My Gain 
 
I made slow Riches but my Gain 
Was steady as the Sun 
And every Night, it numbered more 
Than the preceding One 
All Days, I did not earn the same 
But my perceiveless Gain 
Inferred the less by Growing than 
The Sum that it had grown. 
I Make His Crescent Fill Or Lack 
 
I make His Crescent fill or lack&mdash; 
His Nature is at Full 
Or Quarter&mdash;as I signify&mdash; 
His Tides&mdash;do I control&mdash; 
He holds superior in the Sky 
Or gropes, at my Command 
Behind inferior Clouds&mdash;or round 
A Mist's slow Colonnade&mdash; 
But since We hold a Mutual Disc&mdash; 
And front a Mutual Day&mdash; 
Which is the Despot, neither knows&mdash; 
Nor Whose&mdash;the Tyranny&mdash; 
I Many Times Thought Peace Had Come 
I many times thought Peace had come 
When Peace was far away— 
As Wrecked Men—deem they sight the Land— 
At Centre of the Sea— 
And struggle slacker—but to prove 
As hopelessly as I— 
How many the fictitious Shores— 
Before the Harbor be— 
I Meant To Find Her When I Came 
 
I meant to find Her when I came&mdash; 
Death&mdash;had the same design&mdash; 
But the Success&mdash;was His&mdash;it seems&mdash; 
And the Surrender&mdash;Mine&mdash; 
I meant to tell Her how I longed 
For just this single time&mdash; 
But Death had told Her so the first&mdash; 
And she had past, with Him&mdash; 
To wander&mdash;now&mdash;is my Repose&mdash; 
To rest&mdash;To rest would be 
A privilege of Hurricane 
To Memory&mdash;and Me. 
I Meant To Have But Modest Needs 
 
I meant to have but modest needs&mdash; 
Such as Content&mdash;and Heaven&mdash; 
Within my income&mdash;these could lie 
And Life and I&mdash;keep even&mdash; 
But since the last&mdash;included both&mdash; 
It would suffice my Prayer 
But just for One&mdash;to stipulate&mdash; 
And Grace would grant the Pair&mdash; 
And so&mdash;upon this wise&mdash;I prayed&mdash; 
Great Spirit&mdash;Give to me 
A Heaven not so large as Yours, 
But large enough&mdash;for me&mdash; 
A Smile suffused Jehovah's face&mdash; 
The Cherubim&mdash;withdrew&mdash; 
Grave Saints stole out to look at me&mdash; 
And showed their dimples&mdash;too&mdash; 
I left the Place, with all my might&mdash; 
I threw my Prayer away&mdash; 
The Quiet Ages picked it up&mdash; 
And Judgment&mdash;twinkled&mdash;too&mdash; 
Tat one so honest&mdash;be extant&mdash; 
It take the Tale for true&mdash; 
That "Whatsoever Ye shall ask&mdash; 
Itself be given You"&mdash; 
But I, grown shrewder&mdash;scan the Skies 
With a suspicious Air&mdash; 
As Children&mdash;swindled for the first 
All Swindlers&mdash;be&mdash;infer&mdash; 
I Measure Every Grief I Meet (561) 
I measure every Grief I meet 
With narrow, probing, Eyes-I 
wonder if It weighs like Mine-Or 
has an Easier size. 
I wonder if They bore it long-Or 
did it just begin-I 
could not tell the Date of Mine-It 
feels so old a pain-
I wonder if it hurts to live-And 
if They have to try-And 
whether--could They choose between-It 
would not be--to die-
I note that Some--gone patient long-At 
length, renew their smile-An 
imitation of a Light 
That has so little Oil-
I wonder if when Years have piled-Some 
Thousands--on the Harm-That 
hurt them early--such a lapse 
Could give them any Balm-
Or would they go on aching still 
Through Centuries of Nerve-Enlightened 
to a larger Pain-In 
Contrast with the Love-
The Grieved--are many--I am told-There 
is the various Cause-Death--
is but one--and comes but once-And 
only nails the eyes-
There's Grief of Want--and grief of Cold-A 
sort they call &quot;Despair&quot;-There's 
Banishment from native Eyes-In 
Sight of Native Air-
And though I may not guess the kind-Correctly--
yet to me 
A piercing Comfort it affords 
In passing Calvary-
To note the fashions--of the Cross-And 
how they're mostly worn-Still 
fascinated to presume 
That Some--are like My Own-
I Ment To Find Her When I Came; 
I meant to find her when I came; 
Death had the same design; 
But the success was his, it seems, 
And the discomfit mine. 
I meant to tell her how I longed 
For just this single time; 
But Death had told her so the first, 
And she had hearkened him. 
To wander now is my abode; 
To rest,--to rest would be 
A privilege of hurricane 
To memory and me. 
I Met A King This Afternoon! 
 
I met a King this afternoon! 
He had not on a Crown indeed, 
A little Palmleaf Hat was all, 
And he was barefoot, I'm afraid! 
But sure I am he Ermine wore 
Beneath his faded Jacket's blue&mdash; 
And sure I am, the crest he bore 
Within that Jacket's pocket too! 
For 'twas too stately for an Earl&mdash; 
A Marquis would not go so grand! 
'Twas possibly a Czar petite&mdash; 
A Pope, or something of that kind! 
If I must tell you, of a Horse 
My freckled Monarch held the rein&mdash; 
Doubtless an estimable Beast, 
But not at all disposed to run! 
And such a wagon! While I live 
Dare I presume to see 
Another such a vehicle 
As then transported me! 
Two other ragged Princes 
His royal state partook! 
Doubtless the first excursion 
These sovereigns ever took! 
I question if the Royal Coach 
Round which the Footmen wait 
Has the significance, on high, 
Of this Barefoot Estate! 
I Never Felt At Home—below 
 
I never felt at Home—Below—And 
in the Handsome Skies 
I shall not feel at Home—I know— 
I don't like Paradise— 
Because it's Sunday—all the time— 
And Recess—never comes— 
And Eden'll be so lonesome 
Bright Wednesday Afternoons— 
If God could make a visit— 
Or ever took a Nap— 
So not to see us—but they say 
Himself—a Telescope 
Perennial beholds us— 
Myself would run away 
From Him—and Holy Ghost—and All— 
But there's the "Judgement Day"! 
I Never Hear The Word 'Escape' 
I never hear the word 'escape' 
Without a quicker blood, 
A sudden expectation, 
A flying attitude. 
I never hear of prisons broad 
By soldiers battered down, 
But I tug childish at my bars, -Only 
to fail again! 
I Never Lost As Much But Twice 
 
I never lost as much but twice, 
And that was in the sod. 
Twice have I stood a beggar 
Before the door of God! 
Angels&mdash;twice descending 
Reimbursed my store&mdash; 
Burglar! Banker&mdash;Father! 
I am poor once more! 
I Never Saw A Moor 
I never saw a moor; 
I never saw the sea, 
Yet know I how the heather looks 
And what a billow be. 
I never spoke with God, 
Nor visited in heaven. 
Yet certain am I of the spot 
As if the checks were given. 
I Never Told The Buried Gold 
 
I never told the buried gold 
Upon the hill&mdash;that lies&mdash; 
I saw the sun&mdash;his plunder done 
Crouch low to guard his prize. 
He stood as near 
As stood you here&mdash; 
A pace had been between&mdash; 
Did but a snake bisect the brake 
My life had forfeit been. 
That was a wondrous booty&mdash; 
I hope 'twas honest gained. 
Those were the fairest ingots 
That ever kissed the spade! 
Whether to keep the secret&mdash; 
Whether to reveal&mdash; 
Whether as I ponder 
Kidd will sudden sail&mdash; 
Could a shrewd advise me 
We might e'en divide&mdash; 
Should a shrewd betray me&mdash; 
Atropos decide! 
I Noticed People Disappeared 
I noticed People disappeared 
When but a little child Supposed 
they visited remote 
Or settled Regions wild But 
did because they died 
A Fact withheld the little child 
I Often Passed The Village 
 
I often passed the village 
When going home from school&mdash; 
And wondered what they did there&mdash; 
And why it was so still&mdash; 
I did not know the year then&mdash; 
In which my call would come&mdash; 
Earlier, by the Dial, 
Than the rest have gone. 
It's stiller than the sundown. 
It's cooler than the dawn&mdash; 
The Daisies dare to come here&mdash; 
And birds can flutter down&mdash; 
So when you are tired&mdash; 
Or perplexed&mdash;or cold&mdash; 
Trust the loving promise 
Underneath the mould, 
Cry "it's I," "take Dollie," 
And I will enfold! 
I Pay—in Satin Cash 
 
I pay—in Satin Cash— 
You did not state—your price— 
A Petal, for a Paragraph 
It near as I can guess— 
I Play At Riches—to Appease 
 
I play at Riches—to appease 
The Clamoring for Gold— 
It kept me from a Thief, I think, 
For often, overbold 
With Want, and Opportunity— 
I could have done a Sin 
And been Myself that easy Thing 
An independent Man— 
But often as my lot displays 
Too hungry to be borne 
I deem Myself what I would be— 
And novel Comforting 
My Poverty and I derive— 
We question if the Man— 
Who own—Esteem the Opulence— 
As We—Who never Can— 
Should ever these exploring Hands 
Chance Sovereign on a Mine— 
Or in the long—uneven term 
To win, become their turn— 
How fitter they will be—for Want— 
Enlightening so well— 
I know not which, Desire, or Grant— 
Be wholly beautiful— 
I Prayed, At First, A Little Girl 
 
I prayed, at first, a little Girl, 
Because they told me to&mdash; 
But stopped, when qualified to guess 
How prayer would feel&mdash;to me&mdash; 
If I believed God looked around, 
Each time my Childish eye 
Fixed full, and steady, on his own 
In Childish honesty&mdash; 
And told him what I'd like, today, 
And parts of his far plan 
That baffled me&mdash; 
The mingled side 
Of his Divinity&mdash; 
And often since, in Danger, 
I count the force 'twould be 
To have a God so strong as that 
To hold my life for me 
Till I could take the Balance 
That tips so frequent, now, 
It takes me all the while to poise&mdash; 
And then&mdash;it doesn't stay&mdash; 
I Read My Sentence—steadily 
 
I read my sentence—steadily— 
Reviewed it with my eyes, 
To see that I made no mistake 
In its extremest clause— 
The Date, and manner, of the shame— 
And then the Pious Form 
That "God have mercy" on the Soul 
The Jury voted Him— 
I made my soul familiar—with her extremity— 
That at the last, it should not be a novel Agony— 
But she, and Death, acquainted— 
Meet tranquilly, as friends— 
Salute, and pass, without a Hint— 
And there, the Matter ends— 
I Reason, Earth Is Short 
 
I reason, Earth is short&mdash; 
And Anguish&mdash;absolute&mdash; 
And many hurt, 
But, what of that? 
I reason, we could die&mdash; 
The best Vitality 
Cannot excel Decay, 
But, what of that? 
I reason, that in Heaven&mdash; 
Somehow, it will be even&mdash; 
Some new Equation, given&mdash; 
But, what of that? 
I Reckon—when I Count It All 
 
I reckon—when I count it all— 
First—Poets—Then the Sun— 
Then Summer—Then the Heaven of God— 
And then—the List is done— 
But, looking back—the First so seems 
To Comprehend the Whole— 
The Others look a needless Show— 
So I write—Poets—All— 
Their Summer—lasts a Solid Year— 
They can afford a Sun 
The East—would deem extravagant— 
And if the Further Heaven— 
Be Beautiful as they prepare 
For Those who worship Them— 
It is too difficult a Grace— 
To justify the Dream— 
I Robbed The Woods 
 
I robbed the Woods&mdash; 
The trusting Woods. 
The unsuspecting Trees 
Brought out their Burs and mosses 
My fantasy to please. 
I scanned their trinkets curious&mdash;I grasped&mdash;I bore away&mdash; 
What will the solemn Hemlock&mdash; 
What will the Oak tree say? 
I Rose—because He Sank 
 
I rose—because He sank— 
I thought it would be opposite— 
But when his power dropped— 
My Soul grew straight. 
I cheered my fainting Prince— 
I sang firm—even—Chants— 
I helped his Film—with Hymn— 
And when the Dews drew off 
That held his Forehead stiff— 
I met him— 
Balm to Balm— 
I told him Best—must pass 
Through this low Arch of Flesh— 
No Casque so brave 
It spurn the Grave— 
I told him Worlds I knew 
Where Emperors grew— 
Who recollected us 
If we were true— 
And so with Thews of Hymn— 
And Sinew from within— 
And ways I knew not that I knew—till then— 
I lifted Him— 
I Saw No Way—the Heavens Were Stitched 
 
I saw no Way—The Heavens were stitched— 
I felt the Columns close— 
The Earth reversed her Hemispheres— 
I touched the Universe— 
And back it slid—and I alone— 
A Speck upon a Ball— 
Went out upon Circumference— 
Beyond the Dip of Bell— 
I Saw The Wind Within Her 
I saw the wind within her 
I knew it blew for me — 
But she must buy my shelter 
I asked Humility 
I See Thee Better—in The Dark 
I see thee better—in the Dark— 
I do not need a Light— 
The Love of Thee—a Prism be— 
Excelling Violet— 
I see thee better for the Years 
That hunch themselves between— 
The Miner's Lamp—sufficient be— 
To nullify the Mine— 
And in the Grave—I see Thee best— 
Its little Panels be 
Aglow—All ruddy—with the Light 
I held so high, for Thee— 
What need of Day— 
To Those whose Dark—hath so—surpassing Sun— 
It deem it be—Continually— 
At the Meridian? 
I Send Two Sunsets 
 
I send Two Sunsets&mdash; 
Day and I&mdash;in competition ran&mdash; 
I finished Two&mdash;and several Stars&mdash; 
While He&mdash;was making One&mdash; 
His own was ampler&mdash;but as I 
Was saying to a friend&mdash; 
Mine&mdash;is the more convenient 
To Carry in the Hand&mdash; 
I Shall Keep Singing! 
 
I shall keep singing! 
Birds will pass me 
On their way to Yellower Climes&mdash; 
Each&mdash;with a Robin's expectation&mdash; 
I&mdash;with my Redbreast&mdash; 
And my Rhymes&mdash; 
Late&mdash;when I take my place in summer&mdash; 
But&mdash;I shall bring a fuller tune&mdash; 
Vespers&mdash;are sweeter than Matins&mdash;Signor&mdash; 
Morning&mdash;only the seed of Noon&mdash; 
I Shall Know Why—when Time Is Over 
 
I shall know why—when Time is over— 
And I have ceased to wonder why— 
Christ will explain each separate anguish 
In the fair schoolroom of the sky— 
He will tell me what "Peter" promised— 
And I—for wonder at his woe— 
I shall forget the drop of Anguish 
That scalds me now—that scalds me now! 
I Should Have Been Too Glad, I See 
 
I should have been too glad, I see&mdash; 
Too lifted&mdash;for the scant degree 
Of Life's penurious Round&mdash; 
My little Circuit would have shamed 
This new Circumference&mdash;have blamed&mdash; 
The homelier time behind. 
I should have been too saved&mdash;I see&mdash; 
Too rescued&mdash;Fear too dim to me 
That I could spell the Prayer 
I knew so perfect&mdash;yesterday&mdash; 
That Scalding One&mdash;Sabachthani&mdash; 
Recited fluent&mdash;here&mdash; 
Earth would have been too much&mdash;I see&mdash; 
And Heaven&mdash;not enough for me&mdash; 
I should have had the Joy 
Without the Fear&mdash;to justify&mdash; 
The Palm&mdash;without the Calvary&mdash; 
So Savior&mdash;Crucify&mdash; 
Defeat&mdash;whets Victory&mdash;they say&mdash; 
The Reefs&mdash;in old Gethsemane&mdash; 
Endear the Coast&mdash;beyond! 
'Tis Beggars&mdash;Banquets&mdash;can define&mdash; 
'Tis Parching&mdash;vitalizes Wine&mdash; 
"Faith" bleats&mdash;to understand! 
I Should Not Dare To Leave My Friend 
 
I should not dare to leave my friend, 
Because&mdash;because if he should die 
While I was gone&mdash;and I&mdash;too late&mdash; 
Should reach the Heart that wanted me&mdash; 
If I should disappoint the eyes 
That hunted&mdash;hunted so&mdash;to see&mdash; 
And could not bear to shut until 
They "noticed" me&mdash;they noticed me&mdash; 
If I should stab the patient faith 
So sure I'd come&mdash;so sure I'd come&mdash; 
It listening&mdash;listening&mdash;went to sleep&mdash; 
Telling my tardy name&mdash; 
My Heart would wish it broke before&mdash; 
Since breaking then&mdash;since breaking then&mdash; 
Were useless as next morning's sun&mdash; 
Where midnight frosts&mdash;had lain! 
I Showed Her Heights She Never Saw 
 
I showed her Heights she never saw&mdash; 
"Would'st Climb," I said? 
She said&mdash;"Not so"&mdash; 
"With me&mdash;" I said&mdash;With me? 
I showed her Secrets&mdash;Morning's Nest&mdash; 
The Rope the Nights were put across&mdash; 
And now&mdash;"Would'st have me for a Guest?" 
She could not find her Yes&mdash; 
And then, I brake my life&mdash;And Lo, 
A Light, for her, did solemn glow, 
The larger, as her face withdrew&mdash; 
And could she, further, "No"? 
I Sing To Use The Waiting 
 
I sing to use the Waiting 
My Bonnet but to tie 
And shut the Door unto my House 
No more to do have I 
Till His best step approaching 
We journey to the Day 
And tell each other how We sung 
To Keep the Dark away. 
I Sometimes Drop It, For A Quick 
 
I sometimes drop it, for a Quick&mdash; 
The Thought to be alive&mdash; 
Anonymous Delight to know&mdash; 
And Madder&mdash;to conceive&mdash; 
Consoles a Woe so monstrous 
That did it tear all Day, 
Without an instant's Respite&mdash; 
'Twould look too far&mdash;to Die&mdash; 
I Started Early - Took My Dog 
I started Early - Took my Dog And 
visited the Sea The 
Mermaids in the Basement 
Came out to look at me 
And Frigates - in the Upper Floor 
Extended Hempen Hands Presuming 
Me to be a Mouse Aground 
- upon the Sands 
But no Man moved Me - till the Tide 
Went past my simple Shoe And 
past my Apron - and my Belt 
And past my Bodice - too 
And made as He would eat me up As 
wholly as a Dew 
Upon a Dandelion's Sleeve And 
then - I started - too 
And He - He followed - close behind I 
felt His Silver Heel 
Upon my Ankle - Then my Shoes 
Would overflow with Pearl 
Until We met the Solid Town No 
One He seemed to know And 
bowing - with a Mighty look At 
me - The Sea withdrew 
I Stepped From Plank To Plank 
I stepped from plank to plank 
So slow and cautiously; 
The stars about my head I felt, 
About my feet the sea. 
I knew not but the next 
Would be my final inch,-
This gave me that precarious gait 
Some call experience. 
I Stole Them From A Bee 
 
I stole them from a Bee&mdash; 
Because&mdash;Thee&mdash; 
Sweet plea&mdash; 
He pardoned me! 
I Taste A Liquor Never Brewed 
I taste a liquor never brewed, 
From tankards scooped in pearl; 
Not all the vats upon the Rhine 
Yield such an alcohol! 
Inebriate of air am I, 
And debauchee of dew, 
Reeling, through endless summer days, 
From inns of molten blue. 
When the landlord turn the drunken bee 
Out of the foxglove's door, 
When butterflies renounce their drams, 
I shall but drink the more! 
Till seraphs swing their snowy hats, 
And saints to windows run, 
To see the little tippler 
Leaning against the sun! 
I Tend My Flowers For Thee 
 
I tend my flowers for thee&mdash; 
Bright Absentee! 
My Fuchsia's Coral Seams 
Rip&mdash;while the Sower&mdash;dreams&mdash; 
Geraniums&mdash;tint&mdash;and spot&mdash; 
Low Daisies&mdash;dot&mdash; 
My Cactus&mdash;splits her Beard 
To show her throat&mdash; 
Carnations&mdash;tip their spice&mdash; 
And Bees&mdash;pick up&mdash; 
A Hyacinth&mdash;I hid&mdash; 
Puts out a Ruffled Head&mdash; 
And odors fall 
From flasks&mdash;so small&mdash; 
You marvel how they held&mdash; 
Globe Roses&mdash;break their satin glake&mdash; 
Upon my Garden floor&mdash; 
Yet&mdash;thou&mdash;not there&mdash; 
I had as lief they bore 
No Crimson&mdash;more&mdash; 
Thy flower&mdash;be gay&mdash; 
Her Lord&mdash;away! 
It ill becometh me&mdash; 
I'll dwell in Calyx&mdash;Gray&mdash; 
How modestly&mdash;alway&mdash; 
Thy Daisy&mdash; 
Draped for thee! 
I Think I Was Enchanted 
 
I think I was enchanted 
When first a sombre Girl&mdash; 
I read that Foreign Lady&mdash; 
The Dark&mdash;felt beautiful&mdash; 
And whether it was noon at night&mdash; 
Or only Heaven&mdash;at Noon&mdash; 
For very Lunacy of Light 
I had not power to tell&mdash; 
The Bees&mdash;became as Butterflies&mdash; 
The Butterflies&mdash;as Swans&mdash; 
Approached&mdash;and spurned the narrow Grass&mdash; 
And just the meanest Tunes 
That Nature murmured to herself 
To keep herself in Cheer&mdash; 
I took for Giants&mdash;practising 
Titanic Opera&mdash; 
The Days&mdash;to Mighty Metres stept&mdash; 
The Homeliest&mdash;adorned 
As if unto a Jubilee 
'Twere suddenly confirmed&mdash; 
I could not have defined the change&mdash; 
Conversion of the Mind 
Like Sanctifying in the Soul&mdash; 
Is witnessed&mdash;not explained&mdash; 
'Twas a Divine Insanity&mdash; 
The Danger to be Sane 
Should I again experience&mdash; 
'Tis Antidote to turn&mdash; 
To Tomes of solid Witchcraft&mdash; 
Magicians be asleep&mdash; 
But Magic&mdash;hath an Element 
Like Deity&mdash;to keep&mdash; 
I Think Just How My Shape Will Rise 
 
I think just how my shape will rise&mdash; 
When I shall be "forgiven"&mdash; 
Till Hair&mdash;and Eyes&mdash;and timid Head&mdash; 
Are out of sight&mdash;in Heaven&mdash; 
I think just how my lips will weigh&mdash; 
With shapeless&mdash;quivering&mdash;prayer&mdash; 
That you&mdash;so late&mdash;"Consider" me&mdash; 
The "Sparrow" of your Care&mdash; 
I mind me that of Anguish&mdash;sent&mdash; 
Some drifts were moved away&mdash; 
Before my simple bosom&mdash;broke&mdash; 
And why not this&mdash;if they? 
And so I con that thing&mdash;"forgiven"&mdash; 
Until&mdash;delirious&mdash;borne&mdash; 
By my long bright&mdash;and longer&mdash;trust&mdash; 
I drop my Heart&mdash;unshriven! 
I Think The Hemlock Likes To Stand 
 
I think the Hemlock likes to stand 
Upon a Marge of Snow&mdash; 
It suits his own Austerity&mdash; 
And satisfies an awe 
That men, must slake in Wilderness&mdash; 
And in the Desert&mdash;cloy&mdash; 
An instinct for the Hoar, the Bald&mdash; 
Lapland's&mdash;necessity&mdash; 
The Hemlock's nature thrives&mdash;on cold&mdash; 
The Gnash of Northern winds 
Is sweetest nutriment&mdash;to him&mdash; 
His best Norwegian Wines&mdash; 
To satin Races&mdash;he is nought&mdash; 
But Children on the Don, 
Beneath his Tabernacles, play, 
And Dnieper Wrestlers, run. 
I Think The Longest Hour Of All 
 
I think the longest Hour of all 
Is when the Cars have come&mdash; 
And we are waiting for the Coach&mdash; 
It seems as though the Time 
Indignant&mdash;that the Joy was come&mdash; 
Did block the Gilded Hands&mdash; 
And would not let the Seconds by&mdash; 
But slowest instant&mdash;ends&mdash; 
The Pendulum begins to count&mdash; 
Like little Scholars&mdash;loud&mdash; 
The steps grow thicker&mdash;in the Hall&mdash; 
The Heart begins to crowd&mdash; 
Then I&mdash;my timid service done&mdash; 
Tho' service 'twas, of Love&mdash; 
Take up my little Violin&mdash; 
And further North&mdash;remove. 
I Think To Live—may Be A Bliss 
 
I think to Live—may be a Bliss 
To those who dare to try— 
Beyond my limit to conceive— 
My lip—to testify— 
I think the Heart I former wore 
Could widen—till to me 
The Other, like the little Bank 
Appear—unto the Sea— 
I think the Days—could every one 
In Ordination stand— 
And Majesty—be easier— 
Than an inferior kind— 
No numb alarm—lest Difference come— 
No Goblin—on the Bloom— 
No start in Apprehension's Ear, 
No Bankruptcy—no Doom— 
But Certainties of Sun— 
Midsummer—in the Mind— 
A steadfast South—upon the Soul— 
Her Polar time—behind— 
The Vision—pondered long— 
So plausible becomes 
That I esteem the fiction—real— 
The Real—fictitious seems— 
How bountiful the Dream— 
What Plenty—it would be— 
Had all my Life but been Mistake 
Just rectified—in Thee 
I thought the Train would never come 
I thought the Train would never come How 
slow the whistle sang I 
don't believe a peevish Bird 
So whimpered for the Spring I 
taught my Heart a hundred times 
Precisely what to say Provoking 
Lover, when you came 
Its Treatise flew away 
To hide my strategy too late 
To wiser be too soon For 
miseries so halcyon 
The happiness atone 
I Tie My Hat—i Crease My Shawl 
 
I tie my Hat—I crease my Shawl— 
Life's little duties do—precisely— 
As the very least 
Were infinite—to me— 
I put new Blossoms in the Glass— 
And throw the old—away— 
I push a petal from my gown 
That anchored there—I weigh 
The time 'twill be till six o'clock 
I have so much to do— 
And yet—Existence—some way back— 
Stopped—struck—my tickling—through— 
We cannot put Ourself away 
As a completed Man 
Or Woman—When the Errand's done 
We came to Flesh—upon— 
There may be—Miles on Miles of Nought— 
Of Action—sicker far— 
To simulate—is stinging work— 
To cover what we are 
From Science—and from Surgery— 
Too Telescopic Eyes 
To bear on us unshaded— 
For their—sake—not for Ours— 
'Twould start them— 
We—could tremble— 
But since we got a Bomb— 
And held it in our Bosom— 
Nay—Hold it—it is calm— 
Therefore—we do life's labor— 
Though life's Reward—be done— 
With scrupulous exactness— 
To hold our Senses—on— 
I Took My Power In My Hand 
 
I took my Power in my Hand&mdash; 
And went against the World&mdash; 
'Twas not so much as David&mdash;had&mdash; 
But I&mdash;was twice as bold&mdash; 
I aimed by Pebble&mdash;but Myself 
Was all the one that fell&mdash; 
Was it Goliath&mdash;was too large&mdash; 
Or was myself&mdash;too small? 
I Tried To Think A Lonelier Thing 
 
I tried to think a lonelier Thing 
Than any I had seen&mdash; 
Some Polar Expiation&mdash;An Omen in the Bone 
Of Death's tremendous nearness&mdash; 
I probed Retrieverless things 
My Duplicate&mdash;to borrow&mdash; 
A Haggard Comfort springs 
From the belief that Somewhere&mdash; 
Within the Clutch of Thought&mdash; 
There dwells one other Creature 
Of Heavenly Love&mdash;forgot&mdash; 
I plucked at our Partition 
As One should pry the Walls&mdash; 
Between Himself&mdash;and Horror's Twin&mdash; 
Within Opposing Cells&mdash; 
I almost strove to clasp his Hand, 
Such Luxury&mdash;it grew&mdash; 
That as Myself&mdash;could pity Him&mdash; 
Perhaps he&mdash;pitied me&mdash; 
I Want—it Pleaded—all Its Life— 
"I want"—it pleaded—All its life— 
I want—was chief it said 
When Skill entreated it—the last— 
And when so newly dead— 
I could not deem it late—to hear 
That single—steadfast sigh— 
The lips had placed as with a "Please" 
Toward Eternity— 
I Was The Slightest In The House 
 
I was the slightest in the House&mdash; 
I took the smallest Room&mdash; 
At night, my little Lamp, and Book&mdash; 
And one Geranium&mdash; 
So stationed I could catch the Mint 
That never ceased to fall&mdash; 
And just my Basket&mdash; 
Let me think&mdash;I'm sure&mdash; 
That this was all&mdash; 
I never spoke&mdash;unless addressed&mdash; 
And then, 'twas brief and low&mdash; 
I could not bear to live&mdash;aloud&mdash; 
The Racket shamed me so&mdash; 
And if it had not been so far&mdash; 
And any one I knew 
Were going&mdash;I had often thought 
How noteless&mdash;I could die&mdash; 
I Watched The Moon Around The House (629) 
I watched the Moon around the House 
Until upon a Pane -She 
stopped -- a Traveller's privilege -- for Rest -And 
there upon 
I gazed -- as at a stranger -The 
Lady in the Town 
Doth think no incivility 
To lift her Glass -- upon -
But never Stranger justified 
The Curiosity 
Like Mine -- for not a Foot -- nor Hand -Nor 
Formula -- had she -
But like a Head -- a Guillotine 
Slid carelessly away -Did 
independent, Amber -Sustain 
her in the sky -
Or like a Stemless Flower -Upheld 
in rolling Air 
By finer Gravitations -Than 
bind Philosopher -
No Hunger -- had she -- nor an Inn -Her 
Toilette -- to suffice -Nor 
Avocation nor Concern 
for little Mysteries 
As harass us -- like Life -- and Death -And 
Afterwards -- or Nay -But 
seemed engrossed to Absolute -With 
shining -- and the Sky -
The privilege to scrutinize 
Was scarce upon my Eyes 
When, with a Silver practise -She 
vaulted out of Gaze -
And next -- I met her on a Cloud -Myself 
too far below 
To follow her superior Road -Or 
its advantage -- Blue -
I Went To Heaven,-
I went to heaven,-'
T was a small town, 
Lit with a ruby, 
Lathed with down. 
Stiller than the fields 
At the full dew, 
Beautiful as pictures 
No man drew. 
People like the moth, 
Of mechlin, frames, 
Duties of gossamer, 
And eider names. 
Almost contented 
I could be 
'Mong such unique 
Society. 
I Went To Thank Her 
 
I went to thank Her&mdash; 
But She Slept&mdash; 
Her Bed&mdash;a funneled Stone&mdash; 
With Nosegays at the Head and Foot&mdash; 
That Travellers&mdash;had thrown&mdash; 
Who went to thank Her&mdash; 
But She Slept&mdash; 
'Twas Short&mdash;to cross the Sea&mdash; 
To look upon Her like&mdash;alive&mdash; 
But turning back&mdash;'twas slow&mdash; 
I Would Distil A Cup 
 
I would distil a cup, 
And bear to all my friends, 
Drinking to her no more astir, 
By beck, or burn, or moor! 
I Would Not Paint—a Picture 
 
I would not paint—a picture— 
I'd rather be the One 
Its bright impossibility 
To dwell—delicious—on— 
And wonder how the fingers feel 
Whose rare—celestial—stir— 
Evokes so sweet a Torment— 
Such sumptuous—Despair— 
I would not talk, like Cornets— 
I'd rather be the One 
Raised softly to the Ceilings— 
And out, and easy on— 
Through Villages of Ether— 
Myself endued Balloon 
By but a lip of Metal— 
The pier to my Pontoon— 
Nor would I be a Poet— 
It's finer—own the Ear— 
Enamored—impotent—content— 
The License to revere, 
A privilege so awful 
What would the Dower be, 
Had I the Art to stun myself 
With Bolts of Melody! 
I Years Had Been From Home, 
I years had been from home, 
And now, before the door, 
I dared not open, lest a face 
I never saw before 
Stare vacant into mine 
And ask my business there. 
My business,--just a life I left, 
Was such still dwelling there? 
I fumbled at my nerve, 
I scanned the windows near; 
The silence like an ocean rolled, 
And broke against my ear. 
I laughed a wooden laugh 
That I could fear a door, 
Who danger and the dead had faced, 
But never quaked before. 
I fitted to the latch 
My hand, with trembling care, 
Lest back the awful door should spring, 
And leave me standing there. 
I moved my fingers off 
As cautiously as glass, 
And held my ears, and like a thief 
Fled gasping from the house. 
I’ll Tell You How The Sun Rose 
I’ll tell you how the sun rose, A 
ribbon at a time. 
The steeples swam in amethyst, 
The news like squirrels ran. 
The hills untied their bonnets, 
The bobolinks begun. 
Then I said softly to myself, 
"That must have been the sun!" 
But how he set, I know not. 
There seemed a purple stile. 
Which little yellow boys and girls 
Were climbing all the while 
Till when they reached the other side, 
A dominie in gray 
Put gently up the evening bars, 
And led the flock away. 
Ideals Are The Fairly Oil 
 
Ideals are the Fairly Oil 
With which we help the Wheel 
But when the Vital Axle turns 
The Eye rejects the Oil. 
If all the griefs I am to have 
If all the griefs I am to have 
Would only come today, 
I am so happy I believe 
They'd laugh and run away. 
If all the joys I am to have 
Would only come today, 
They could not be so big as this 
That happens to me now. 
If Any Sink, Assure That This, Now Standing 
 
If any sink, assure that this, now standing&mdash; 
Failed like Themselves&mdash;and conscious that it rose&mdash; 
Grew by the Fact, and not the Understanding 
How Weakness passed&mdash;or Force&mdash;arose&mdash; 
Tell that the Worst, is easy in a Moment&mdash; 
Dread, but the Whizzing, before the Ball&mdash; 
When the Ball enters, enters Silence&mdash; 
Dying&mdash;annuls the power to kill. 
If Anybody's Friend Be Dead 
 
If anybody's friend be dead 
It's sharpest of the theme 
The thinking how they walked alive&mdash; 
At such and such a time&mdash; 
Their costume, of a Sunday, 
Some manner of the Hair&mdash; 
A prank nobody knew but them 
Lost, in the Sepulchre&mdash; 
How warm, they were, on such a day, 
You almost feel the date&mdash; 
So short way off it seems&mdash; 
And now&mdash;they're Centuries from that&mdash; 
How pleased they were, at what you said&mdash; 
You try to touch the smile 
And dip your fingers in the frost&mdash; 
When was it&mdash;Can you tell&mdash; 
You asked the Company to tea&mdash; 
Acquaintance&mdash;just a few&mdash; 
And chatted close with this Grand Thing 
That don't remember you&mdash; 
Past Bows, and Invitations&mdash; 
Past Interview, and Vow&mdash; 
Past what Ourself can estimate&mdash; 
That&mdash;makes the Quick of Woe! 
If Blame Be My Side—forfeit Me 
 
If Blame be my side—forfeit Me— 
But doom me not to forfeit Thee— 
To forfeit Thee? The very name 
Is sentence from Belief—and House— 
If Ever The Lid Gets Off My Head 
If ever the lid gets off my head 
And lets the brain away 
The fellow will go where he belonged Without 
a hint from me, 
And the world -if the world be looking on Will 
see how far from home 
It is possible for sense to live 
The soul there -all the time. 
If He Dissolve—then—there Is Nothing 
 
If He dissolve—then—there is nothing—more— 
Eclipse—at Midnight— 
It was dark—before— 
Sunset—at Easter— 
Blindness—on the Dawn— 
Faint Star of Bethlehem— 
Gone down! 
Would but some God—inform Him— 
Or it be too late! 
Say—that the pulse just lisps— 
The Chariots wait— 
Say—that a little life—for His— 
Is leaking—red— 
His little Spaniel—tell Him! 
Will He heed? 
If He Were Living—dare I Ask 
 
If He were living—dare I ask— 
And how if He be dead— 
And so around the Words I went— 
Of meeting them—afraid— 
I hinted Changes—Lapse of Time— 
The Surfaces of Years— 
I touched with Caution—lest they crack— 
And show me to my fears— 
Reverted to adjoining Lives— 
Adroitly turning out 
Wherever I suspected Graves— 
'Twas prudenter—I thought— 
And He—I pushed—with sudden force— 
In face of the Suspense— 
"Was buried"—"Buried"! "He!" 
My Life just holds the Trench— 
If I Can Stop One Heart From Breaking, 
If I can stop one heart from breaking, 
I shall not live in vain; 
If I can ease one life the aching, 
Or cool one pain, 
Or help one fainting robin 
Unto his nest again, 
I shall not live in vain. 
If I Could Bribe Them By A Rose 
 
If I could bribe them by a Rose 
I'd bring them every flower that grows 
From Amherst to Cashmere! 
I would not stop for night, or storm&mdash; 
Or frost, or death, or anyone&mdash; 
My business were so dear! 
If they would linger for a Bird 
My Tambourin were soonest heard 
Among the April Woods! 
Unwearied, all the summer long, 
Only to break in wilder song 
When Winter shook the boughs! 
What if they hear me! 
Who shall say 
That such an importunity 
May not at last avail? 
That, weary of this Beggar's face&mdash; 
They may not finally say, Yes&mdash; 
To drive her from the Hall? 
If I May Have It, When It's Dead 
 
If I may have it, when it's dead, 
I'll be contented&mdash;so&mdash; 
If just as soon as Breath is out 
It shall belong to me&mdash; 
Until they lock it in the Grave, 
'Tis Bliss I cannot weigh&mdash; 
For tho' they lock Thee in the Grave, 
Myself&mdash;can own the key&mdash; 
Think of it Lover! I and Thee 
Permitted&mdash;face to face to be&mdash; 
After a Life&mdash;a Death&mdash;We'll say&mdash; 
For Death was That&mdash; 
And this&mdash;is Thee&mdash; 
I'll tell Thee All&mdash;how Bald it grew&mdash; 
How Midnight felt, at first&mdash;to me&mdash; 
How all the Clocks stopped in the World&mdash; 
And Sunshine pinched me&mdash;'Twas so cold&mdash; 
Then how the Grief got sleepy&mdash;some&mdash; 
As if my Soul were deaf and dumb&mdash; 
Just making signs&mdash;across&mdash;to Thee&mdash; 
That this way&mdash;thou could'st notice me&mdash; 
I'll tell you how I tried to keep 
A smile, to show you, when this Deep 
All Waded&mdash;We look back for Play, 
At those Old Times&mdash;in Calvary, 
Forgive me, if the Grave come slow&mdash; 
For Coveting to look at Thee&mdash; 
Forgive me, if to stroke thy frost 
Outvisions Paradise! 
If I Should Cease To Bring A Rose 
 
If I should cease to bring a Rose 
Upon a festal day, 
'Twill be because beyond the Rose 
I have been called away&mdash; 
If I should cease to take the names 
My buds commemorate&mdash; 
'Twill be because Death's finger 
Claps my murmuring lip! 
If I Should Die 
 
If I should die, 
And you should live&mdash; 
And time should gurgle on&mdash; 
And morn should beam&mdash; 
And noon should burn&mdash; 
As it has usual done&mdash; 
If Birds should build as early 
And Bees as bustling go&mdash; 
One might depart at option 
From enterprise below! 
'Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand 
When we with Daisies lie&mdash; 
That Commerce will continue&mdash; 
And Trades as briskly fly&mdash; 
It makes the parting tranquil 
And keeps the soul serene&mdash; 
That gentlemen so sprightly 
Conduct the pleasing scene! 
If I Shouldn'T Be Alive 
 
If I shouldn't be alive 
When the Robins come, 
Give the one in Red Cravat, 
A Memorial crumb. 
If I couldn't thank you, 
Being fast asleep, 
You will know I'm trying 
Why my Granite lip! 
If I'M Lost&Mdash;Now 
 
If I'm lost&mdash;now 
That I was found&mdash; 
Shall still my transport be&mdash; 
That once&mdash;on me&mdash;those Jasper Gates 
Blazed open&mdash;suddenly&mdash; 
That in my awkward&mdash;gazing&mdash;face&mdash; 
The Angels&mdash;softly peered&mdash; 
And touched me with their fleeces, 
Almost as if they cared&mdash; 
I'm banished&mdash;now&mdash;you know it&mdash; 
How foreign that can be&mdash; 
You'll know&mdash;Sir&mdash;when the Savior's face 
Turns so&mdash;away from you&mdash; 
If It Had No Pencil 
 
If it had no pencil 
Would it try mine&mdash; 
Worn&mdash;now&mdash;and dull&mdash;sweet, 
Writing much to thee. 
If it had no word, 
Would it make the Daisy, 
Most as big as I was, 
When it plucked me? 
If Nature Smiles -The Mother Must 
If Nature smiles -the Mother must 
I'm sure, at many a whim 
Of Her eccentric Family Is 
She so much to blame? 
If Pain For Peace Prepares 
 
If pain for peace prepares 
Lo, what "Augustan" years 
Our feet await! 
If springs from winter rise, 
Can the Anemones 
Be reckoned up? 
If night stands fast&mdash;then noon 
To gird us for the sun, 
What gaze! 
When from a thousand skies 
On our developed eyes 
Noons blaze! 
If Recollecting Were Forgetting 
 
If recollecting were forgetting, 
Then I remember not. 
And if forgetting, recollecting, 
How near I had forgot. 
And if to miss, were merry, 
And to mourn, were gay, 
How very blithe the fingers 
That gathered this, Today! 
If She Had Been The Mistletoe 
 
If she had been the Mistletoe 
And I had been the Rose&mdash; 
How gay upon your table 
My velvet life to close&mdash; 
Since I am of the Druid, 
And she is of the dew&mdash; 
I'll deck Tradition's buttonhole&mdash; 
And send the Rose to you. 
If The Foolish, Call Them "Flowers" 
 
If the foolish, call them "flowers"&mdash; 
Need the wiser, tell? 
If the Savants "Classify" them 
It is just as well! 
Those who read the "Revelations" 
Must not criticize 
Those who read the same Edition&mdash; 
With beclouded Eyes! 
Could we stand with that Old "Moses"&mdash; 
"Canaan" denied&mdash; 
Scan like him, the stately landscape 
On the other side&mdash; 
Doubtless, we should deem superfluous 
Many Sciences, 
Not pursued by learned Angels 
In scholastic skies! 
Low amid that glad Belles lettres 
Grant that we may stand, 
Stars, amid profound Galaxies&mdash; 
At that grand "Right hand"! 
If This Is "Fading" 
 
If this is "fading" 
Oh let me immediately "fade"! 
If this is "dying" 
Bury me, in such a shroud of red! 
If this is "sleep," 
On such a night 
How proud to shut the eye! 
Good Evening, gentle Fellow men! 
Peacock presumes to die! 
If Those I Loved Were Lost 
 
If those I loved were lost 
The Crier's voice would tell me&mdash; 
If those I loved were found 
The bells of Ghent would ring&mdash; 
Did those I loved repose 
The Daisy would impel me. 
Philip&mdash;when bewildered 
Bore his riddle in! 
If What We Could&Mdash;Were What We Would 
 
If What we could&mdash;were what we would&mdash; 
Criterion&mdash;be small&mdash; 
It is the Ultimate of Talk&mdash; 
The Impotence to Tell&mdash; 
If You Were Coming In The Fall, 
If you were coming in the fall, 
I'd brush the summer by 
With half a smile and half a spum, 
As housewives do a fly. 
If I could see you in a year, 
I'd wind the months in balls, 
And put them each in separate drawers, 
Until their time befalls. 
If only centuries delayed, 
I'd count them on my hand, 
Subtracting till my fingers dropped 
Into Van Diemen's land. 
If certain, when this life was out, 
That yours and mine should be, 
I'd toss it yonder like a rind, 
And taste eternity. 
But now, all ignorant of the length 
Of time's uncertain wing, 
It goads me, like the goblin bee, 
That will not state its sting. 
If Your Nerve, Deny You 
 
If your Nerve, deny you&mdash; 
Go above your Nerve&mdash; 
He can lean against the Grave, 
If he fear to swerve&mdash; 
That's a steady posture&mdash; 
Never any bend 
Held of those Brass arms&mdash; 
Best Giant made&mdash; 
If your Soul seesaw&mdash; 
Lift the Flesh door&mdash; 
The Poltroon wants Oxygen&mdash; 
Nothing more&mdash; 
I'Ll Clutch—and Clutch 
 
I'll clutch—and clutch— 
Next—One—Might be the golden touch— 
Could take it— 
Diamonds—Wait— 
I'm diving—just a little late— 
But stars—go slow—for night— 
I'll string you—in fine Necklace— 
Tiaras—make—of some— 
Wear you on Hem— 
Loop up a Countess—with you— 
Make—a Diadem—and mend my old One— 
Count—Hoard—then lose— 
And doubt that you are mine— 
To have the joy of feeling it—again— 
I'll show you at the Court— 
Bear you—for Ornament 
Where Women breathe— 
That every sigh—may lift you 
Just as high—as I— 
And—when I die— 
In meek array—display you— 
Still to show—how rich I go— 
Lest Skies impeach a wealth so wonderful— 
And banish me— 
I'Ll Send The Feather From My Hat! 
 
I'll send the feather from my Hat! 
Who knows&mdash;but at the sight of that 
My Sovereign will relent? 
As trinket&mdash;worn by faded Child&mdash; 
Confronting eyes long&mdash;comforted&mdash; 
Blisters the Adamant! 
I'M 
 
I'm "wife"—I've finished that— 
That other state— 
I'm Czar—I'm "Woman" now— 
It's safer so— 
How odd the Girl's life looks 
Behind this soft Eclipse— 
I think that Earth feels so 
To folks in Heaven—now— 
This being comfort—then 
That other kind—was pain— 
But why compare? 
I'm "Wife"! Stop there! 
I'M "Wife"&Mdash;I'Ve Finished That 
 
I'm "wife"&mdash;I've finished that&mdash; 
That other state&mdash; 
I'm Czar&mdash;I'm "Woman" now&mdash; 
It's safer so&mdash; 
How odd the Girl's life looks 
Behind this soft Eclipse&mdash; 
I think that Earth feels so 
To folks in Heaven&mdash;now&mdash; 
This being comfort&mdash;then 
That other kind&mdash;was pain&mdash; 
But why compare? 
I'm "Wife"! Stop there! 
I'M Ceded—i'Ve Stopped Being Theirs 
 
I'm ceded—I've stopped being Theirs— 
The name They dropped upon my face 
With water, in the country church 
Is finished using, now, 
And They can put it with my Dolls, 
My childhood, and the string of spools, 
I've finished threading—too— 
Baptized, before, without the choice, 
But this time, consciously, of Grace— 
Unto supremest name— 
Called to my Full—The Crescent dropped— 
Existence's whole Arc, filled up, 
With one small Diadem. 
My second Rank—too small the first— 
Crowned—Crowing—on my Father's breast— 
A half unconscious Queen— 
But this time—Adequate—Erect, 
With Will to choose, or to reject, 
And I choose, just a Crown— 
I'M Nobody! Who Are You? 
I'm nobody! Who are you? 
Are you nobody, too? 
Then there's a pair of us -- don't tell! 
They'd banish -- you know! 
How dreary to be somebody! 
How public like a frog 
To tell one's name the livelong day 
To an admiring bog! 
I'M Saying Every Day 
 
I'm saying every day 
"If I should be a Queen, tomorrow"&mdash; 
I'd do this way&mdash; 
And so I deck, a little, 
If it be, I wake a Bourbon, 
None on me, bend supercilious&mdash; 
With "This was she&mdash; 
Begged in the Market place&mdash; 
Yesterday." 
Court is a stately place&mdash; 
I've heard men say&mdash; 
So I loop my apron, against the Majesty 
With bright Pins of Buttercup&mdash; 
That not too plain&mdash; 
Rank&mdash;overtake me&mdash; 
And perch my Tongue 
On Twigs of singing&mdash;rather high&mdash; 
But this, might be my brief Term 
To qualify&mdash; 
Put from my simple speech all plain word&mdash; 
Take other accents, as such I heard 
Though but for the Cricket&mdash;just, 
And but for the Bee&mdash; 
Not in all the Meadow&mdash; 
One accost me&mdash; 
Better to be ready&mdash; 
Than did next morn 
Meet me in Aragon&mdash; 
My old Gown&mdash;on&mdash; 
And the surprised Air 
Rustics&mdash;wear&mdash; 
Summoned&mdash;unexpectedly&mdash; 
To Exeter&mdash; 
I'M Sorry For The Dead—today 
 
I'm sorry for the Dead—Today— 
It's such congenial times 
Old Neighbors have at fences— 
It's time o' year for Hay. 
And Broad—Sunburned Acquaintance 
Discourse between the Toil— 
And laugh, a homely species 
That makes the Fences smile— 
It seems so straight to lie away 
From all of the noise of Fields— 
The Busy Carts—the fragrant Cocks— 
The Mower's Metre—Steals— 
A Trouble lest they're homesick— 
Those Farmers—and their Wives— 
Set separate from the Farming— 
And all the Neighbors' lives— 
A Wonder if the Sepulchre 
Don't feel a lonesome way— 
When Men—and Boys—and Carts—and June, 
Go down the Fields to "Hay"— 
I'M The Little 
 
I'm the little "Heart's Ease"! 
I don't care for pouting skies! 
If the Butterfly delay 
Can I, therefore, stay away? 
If the Coward Bumble Bee 
In his chimney corner stay, 
I, must resoluter be! 
Who'll apologize for me? 
Dear, Old fashioned, little flower! 
Eden is old fashioned, too! 
Birds are antiquated fellows! 
Heaven does not change her blue. 
Nor will I, the little Heart's Ease— 
Ever be induced to do! 
I'M The Little "Heart's Ease" 
 
I'm the little "Heart's Ease"! 
I don't care for pouting skies! 
If the Butterfly delay 
Can I, therefore, stay away?

Dear, Old fashioned, little flower! 
Eden is old fashioned, too! 
Birds are antiquated fellows! 
Heaven does not change her blue. 
Nor will I, the little Heart's Ease&mdash; 
Ever be induced to do! 
Image of Light, Adieu 
Image of Light, Adieu Thanks 
for the interview So 
long -so short Preceptor 
of the whole Coeval 
Cardinal Impart 
-Depart 
Immured in Heaven! 
Immured in Heaven! 
What a Cell! 
Let every Bondage be, 
Thou sweetest of the Universe, 
Like that which ravished thee! 
Impossibility, Like Wine 
 
Impossibility, like Wine 
Exhilarates the Man 
Who tastes it; Possibility 
Is flavorless&mdash;Combine 
A Chance's faintest Tincture 
And in the former Dram 
Enchantment makes ingredient 
As certainly as Doom&mdash; 
In Ebon Box, When Years Have Flown 
 
In Ebon Box, when years have flown 
To reverently peer, 
Wiping away the velvet dust 
Summers have sprinkled there! 
To hold a letter to the light&mdash; 
Grown Tawny now, with time&mdash; 
To con the faded syllables 
That quickened us like Wine! 
Perhaps a Flower's shrivelled check 
Among its stores to find&mdash; 
Plucked far away, some morning&mdash; 
By gallant&mdash;mouldering hand! 
A curl, perhaps, from foreheads 
Our Constancy forgot&mdash; 
Perhaps, an Antique trinket&mdash; 
In vanished fashions set! 
And then to lay them quiet back&mdash; 
And go about its care&mdash; 
As if the little Ebon Box 
Were none of our affair! 
In Falling Timbers Buried 
 
In falling Timbers buried&mdash; 
There breathed a Man&mdash; 
Outside&mdash;the spades&mdash;were plying&mdash; 
The Lungs&mdash;within&mdash; 
Could He&mdash;know&mdash;they sought Him&mdash; 
Could They&mdash;know&mdash;He breathed&mdash; 
Horrid Sand Partition&mdash; 
Neither&mdash;could be heard&mdash; 
Never slacked the Diggers&mdash; 
But when Spades had done&mdash; 
Oh, Reward of Anguish, 
It was dying&mdash;Then&mdash; 
Many Things&mdash;are fruitless&mdash; 
'Tis a Baffling Earth&mdash; 
But there is no Gratitude 
Like the Grace&mdash;of Death&mdash; 
In Lands I Never Saw—they Say 
 
In lands I never saw—they say 
Immortal Alps look down— 
Whose Bonnets touch the firmament— 
Whose Sandals touch the town— 
Meek at whose everlasting feet 
A Myriad Daisy play— 
Which, Sir, are you and which am I 
Upon an August day? 
In Rags Mysterious As These 
 
In rags mysterious as these 
The shining Courtiers go&mdash; 
Veiling the purple, and the plumes&mdash; 
Veiling the ermine so. 
Smiling, as they request an alms&mdash; 
At some imposing door! 
Smiling when we walk barefoot 
Upon their golden floor! 
In Snow Thou Comest 
In snow thou comest Thou 
shalt go with the resuming ground, 
The sweet derision of the crow, 
And Glee's advancing sound. 
In fear thou comest Thou 
shalt go at such a gait of joy 
That man anew embark to live 
Upon the depth of thee. 
In This Short Life 
That only lasts an hour 
How much — how little — is 
Within our power 
In Winter In My Room 
 
In Winter in my Room 
I came upon a Worm&mdash; 
Pink, lank and warm&mdash; 
But as he was a worm 
And worms presume 
Not quite with him at home&mdash; 
Secured him by a string 
To something neighboring 
And went along. 
A Trifle afterward 
A thing occurred 
I'd not believe it if I heard 
But state with creeping blood&mdash; 
A snake with mottles rare 
Surveyed my chamber floor 
In feature as the worm before 
But ringed with power&mdash; 
The very string with which 
I tied him&mdash;too 
When he was mean and new 
That string was there&mdash; 
I shrank&mdash;"How fair you are"! 
Propitiation's claw&mdash; 
"Afraid," he hissed 
"Of me"? 
"No cordiality"&mdash; 
He fathomed me&mdash; 
Then to a Rhythm Slim 
Secreted in his Form 
As Patterns swim 
Projected him. 
That time I flew 
Both eyes his way 
Lest he pursue 
Nor ever ceased to run 
Till in a distant Town 
Towns on from mine 
I set me down 
This was a dream. 
Inconceivably Solemn! 
 
Inconceivably solemn! 
Things go gay 
Pierce&mdash;by the very Press 
Of Imagery&mdash; 
Their far Parades&mdash;order on the eye 
With a mute Pomp&mdash; 
A pleading Pageantry&mdash; 
Flags, are a brave sight&mdash; 
But no true Eye 
Ever went by One&mdash; 
Steadily&mdash; 
Music's triumphant&mdash; 
But the fine Ear 
Winces with delight 
Are Drums too near&mdash; 
Is Bliss Then, Such Abyss 
 
Is Bliss then, such Abyss, 
I must not put my foot amiss 
For fear I spoil my shoe? 
I'd rather suit my foot 
Than save my Boot&mdash; 
For yet to buy another Pair 
Is possible, 
At any store&mdash; 
But Bliss, is sold just once. 
The Patent lost 
None buy it any more&mdash; 
Say, Foot, decide the point&mdash; 
The Lady cross, or not? 
Verdict for Boot! 
Is It Dead—find It 
 
Is it dead—Find it— 
Out of sound—Out of sight— 
"Happy"? Which is wiser— 
You, or the Wind? 
"Conscious"? Won't you ask that— 
Of the low Ground? 
"Homesick"? Many met it— 
Even through them—This 
Cannot testify— 
Themself—as dumb— 
Is It Too Late To Touch You, Dear? 
Is it too late to touch you, Dear? 
We this moment knew Love 
Marine and Love terrene Love 
celestial too 
Is It True, Dear Sue? 
 
Is it true, dear Sue? 
Are there two? 
I shouldn't like to come 
For fear of joggling Him! 
If I could shut him up 
In a Coffee Cup, 
Or tie him to a pin 
Till I got in&mdash; 
Or make him fast 
To "Toby's" fist&mdash; 
Hist! Whist! I'd come! 
It Always Felt To Me—a Wrong 
 
It always felt to me—a wrong 
To that Old Moses—done— 
To let him see—the Canaan— 
Without the entering— 
And tho' in soberer moments— 
No Moses there can be 
I'm satisfied—the Romance 
In point of injury— 
Surpasses sharper stated— 
Of Stephen—or of Paul— 
For these—were only put to death— 
While God's adroiter will 
On Moses—seemed to fasten 
With tantalizing Play 
As Boy—should deal with lesser Boy— 
To prove ability. 
The fault—was doubtless Israel's— 
Myself—had banned the Tribes— 
And ushered Grand Old Moses 
In Pentateuchal Robes 
Upon the Broad Possession 
'Twas little—But titled Him—to see— 
Old Man on Nebo! Late as this— 
My justice bleeds—for Thee! 
It Bloomed And Dropt, A Single Noon 
 
It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon&mdash; 
The Flower&mdash;distinct and Red&mdash; 
I, passing, thought another Noon 
Another in its stead 
Will equal glow, and thought no More 
But came another Day 
To find the Species disappeared&mdash; 
The Same Locality&mdash; 
The Sun in place&mdash;no other fraud 
On Nature's perfect Sum&mdash; 
Had I but lingered Yesterday&mdash; 
Was my retrieveless blame&mdash; 
Much Flowers of this and further Zones 
Have perished in my Hands 
For seeking its Resemblance&mdash; 
But unapproached it stands&mdash; 
The single Flower of the Earth 
That I, in passing by 
Unconscious was&mdash;Great Nature's Face 
Passed infinite by Me&mdash; 
It Can'T Be "Summer"! 
 
It can't be "Summer"! 
That&mdash;got through! 
It's early&mdash;yet&mdash;for "Spring"! 
There's that long town of White&mdash;to cross&mdash; 
Before the Blackbirds sing! 
It can't be "Dying"! 
It's too Rouge&mdash; 
The Dead shall go in White&mdash; 
So Sunset shuts my question down 
With Cuffs of Chrysolite! 
It Ceased To Hurt Me, Though So Slow 
 
It ceased to hurt me, though so slow 
I could not feel the Anguish go&mdash; 
But only knew by looking back&mdash; 
That something&mdash;had benumbed the Track&mdash; 
Nor when it altered, I could say, 
For I had worn it, every day, 
As constant as the Childish frock&mdash; 
I hung upon the Peg, at night. 
But not the Grief&mdash;that nestled close 
As needles&mdash;ladies softly press 
To Cushions Cheeks&mdash; 
To keep their place&mdash; 
Nor what consoled it, I could trace&mdash; 
Except, whereas 'twas Wilderness&mdash; 
It's better&mdash;almost Peace&mdash; 
It Did Not Surprise Me 
 
It did not surprise me&mdash; 
So I said&mdash;or thought&mdash; 
She will stir her pinions 
And the nest forgot, 
Traverse broader forests&mdash; 
Build in gayer boughs, 
Breathe in Ear more modern 
God's old fashioned vows&mdash; 
This was but a Birdling&mdash; 
What and if it be 
One within my bosom 
Had departed me? 
This was but a story&mdash; 
What and if indeed 
There were just such coffin 
In the heart instead? 
It Don'T Sound So Terrible—quite—as It Did 
 
It don't sound so terrible—quite—as it did— 
I run it over—"Dead", Brain, "Dead." 
Put it in Latin—left of my school— 
Seems it don't shriek so—under rule. 
Turn it, a little—full in the face 
A Trouble looks bitterest— 
Shift it—just— 
Say "When Tomorrow comes this way— 
I shall have waded down one Day." 
I suppose it will interrupt me some 
Till I get accustomed—but then the Tomb 
Like other new Things—shows largest—then— 
And smaller, by Habit— 
It's shrewder then 
Put the Thought in advance—a Year— 
How like "a fit"—then— 
Murder—wear! 
It Dropped So Low -- In My Regard -
It dropped so low -- in my Regard -I 
heard it hit the Ground -And 
go to pieces on the Stones 
At bottom of my Mind -
Yet blamed the Fate that flung it -- less 
Than I denounced Myself, 
For entertaining Plated Wares 
Upon My Silver Shelf -
It Dropped So Low In My Regard 
It dropped so low in my regard 
I heard it hit the ground, 
And go to pieces on the stones 
At bottom of my mind; 
Yet blamed the fate that fractured, less 
Than I reviled myself 
For entertaining plated wares 
Upon my silver shelf. 
It Feels A Shame To Be Alive 
 
It feels a shame to be Alive&mdash; 
When Men so brave&mdash;are dead&mdash; 
One envies the Distinguished Dust&mdash; 
Permitted&mdash;such a Head&mdash; 
The Stone&mdash;that tells defending Whom 
This Spartan put away 
What little of Him we&mdash;possessed 
In Pawn for Liberty&mdash; 
The price is great&mdash;Sublimely paid&mdash; 
Do we deserve&mdash;a Thing&mdash; 
That lives&mdash;like Dollars&mdash;must be piled 
Before we may obtain? 
Are we that wait&mdash;sufficient worth&mdash; 
That such Enormous Pearl 
As life&mdash;dissolved be&mdash;for Us&mdash; 
In Battle's&mdash;horrid Bowl? 
It may be&mdash;a Renown to live&mdash; 
I think the Man who die&mdash; 
Those unsustained&mdash;Saviors&mdash; 
Present Divinity&mdash; 
It Is A Lonesome Glee 
 
It is a lonesome Glee&mdash; 
Yet sanctifies the Mind&mdash; 
With fair association&mdash; 
Afar upon the Wind 
A Bird to overhear 
Delight without a Cause&mdash; 
Arrestless as invisible&mdash; 
A matter of the Skies. 
It Is An Honorable Thought, 
It is an honorable thought, 
And makes one lift one's hat, 
As one encountered gentlefolk 
Upon a daily street, 
That we've immortal place, 
Though pyramids decay, 
And kingdoms, like the orchard, 
Flit russetly away. 
It Is Easy To Work When The Soul Is At Play 
 
It is easy to work when the soul is at play&mdash; 
But when the soul is in pain&mdash; 
The hearing him put his playthings up 
Makes work difficult&mdash;then&mdash; 
It is simple, to ache in the Bone, or the Rind&mdash; 
But Gimlets&mdash;among the nerve&mdash; 
Mangle daintier&mdash;terribler&mdash; 
Like a Panter in the Glove&mdash; 
It Knew No Lapse, Nor Diminuation 
 
It knew no lapse, nor Diminuation&mdash; 
But large&mdash;serene&mdash; 
Burned on&mdash;until through Dissolution&mdash; 
It failed from Men&mdash; 
I could not deem these Planetary forces 
Annulled&mdash; 
But suffered an Exchange of Territory&mdash; 
Or World&mdash; 
It Knew No Medicine 
 
It knew no Medicine&mdash; 
It was not Sickness&mdash;then&mdash; 
Nor any need of Surgery&mdash; 
And therefore&mdash;'twas not Pain&mdash; 
It moved away the Cheeks&mdash; 
A Dimple at a time&mdash; 
And left the Profile&mdash;plainer&mdash; 
And in the place of Bloom 
It left the little Tint 
That never had a Name&mdash; 
You've seen it on a Cast's face&mdash; 
Was Paradise&mdash;to blame&mdash; 
If momently ajar&mdash; 
Temerity&mdash;drew near&mdash; 
And sickened&mdash;ever afterward 
For Somewhat that it saw? 
It Makes No Difference Abroad 
 
It makes no difference abroad&mdash; 
The Seasons&mdash;fit&mdash;the same&mdash; 
The Mornings blossom into Noons&mdash; 
And split their Pods of Flame&mdash; 
Wild flowers&mdash;kindle in the Woods&mdash; 
The Brooks slam&mdash;all the Day&mdash; 
No Black bird bates his Banjo&mdash; 
For passing Calvary&mdash; 
Auto da Fe&mdash;and Judgment&mdash; 
Are nothing to the Bee&mdash; 
His separation from His Rose&mdash; 
To Him&mdash;sums Misery&mdash; 
It Might Be Lonelier 
 
It might be lonelier 
Without the Loneliness&mdash; 
I'm so accustomed to my Fate&mdash; 
Perhaps the Other&mdash;Peace&mdash; 
Would interrupt the Dark&mdash; 
And crowd the little Room&mdash; 
Too scant&mdash;by Cubits&mdash;to contain 
The Sacrament&mdash;of Him&mdash; 
I am not used to Hope&mdash; 
It might intrude upon&mdash; 
Its sweet parade&mdash;blaspheme the place&mdash; 
Ordained to Suffering&mdash; 
It might be easier 
To fail&mdash;with Land in Sight&mdash; 
Than gain&mdash;My Blue Peninsula&mdash; 
To perish&mdash;of Delight&mdash; 
It Sifts From Leaden Sieves 
 
It sifts from Leaden Sieves&mdash; 
It powders all the Wood. 
It fills with Alabaster Wool 
The Wrinkles of the Road&mdash; 
It makes an Even Face 
Of Mountain, and of Plain&mdash; 
Unbroken Forehead from the East 
Unto the East again&mdash; 
It reaches to the Fence&mdash; 
It wraps it Rail by Rail 
Till it is lost in Fleeces&mdash; 
It deals Celestial Vail 
To Stump, and Stack&mdash;and Stem&mdash; 
A Summer's empty Room&mdash; 
Acres of Joints, where Harvests were, 
Recordless, but for them-
It Ruffles Wrists of Posts 
As Ankles of a Queen&mdash; 
Then stills its Artisans&mdash;like Ghosts&mdash; 
Denying they have been&mdash; 
It sounded as if the Streets were running 
It sounded as if the Streets were running 
And then -the Streets stood still Eclipse 
-was all we could see at the Window 
And Awe -was all we could feel. 
By and by -the boldest stole out of his Covert 
To see if Time was there Nature 
was in an Opal Apron, 
Mixing fresher Air. 
It stole along so stealthy 
It stole along so stealthy 
Suspicion it was done 
Was dim as to the wealthy 
Beginning not to own 
It Struck Me Every Day 
It struck me every day 
The lightning was as new 
As if the cloud that instant slit 
And let the fire through. 
It burned me in the night, 
It blistered in my dream; 
It sickened fresh upon my sight 
With every morning's beam. 
I thought that storm was brief,-The 
maddest, quickest by; 
But Nature lost the date of this, 
And left it in the sky. 
It Tossed—and Tossed 
 
It tossed—and tossed— 
A little Brig I knew—o'ertook by Blast— 
It spun—and spun— 
And groped delirious, for Morn— 
It slipped—and slipped— 
As One that drunken—stept— 
Its white foot tripped— 
Then dropped from sight— 
Ah, Brig—Good Night 
To Crew and You— 
The Ocean's Heart too smooth—too Blue— 
To break for You— 
It Troubled Me As Once I Was 
 
It troubled me as once I was&mdash; 
For I was once a Child&mdash; 
Concluding how an Atom&mdash;fell&mdash; 
And yet the Heavens&mdash;held&mdash; 
The Heavens weighed the most&mdash;by far&mdash; 
Yet Blue&mdash;and solid&mdash;stood&mdash; 
Without a Bolt&mdash;that I could prove&mdash; 
Would Giants&mdash;understand? 
Life set me larger&mdash;problems&mdash; 
Some I shall keep&mdash;to solve 
Till Algebra is easier&mdash; 
Or simpler proved&mdash;above&mdash; 
Then&mdash;too&mdash;be comprehended&mdash; 
What sorer&mdash;puzzled me&mdash; 
Why Heaven did not break away&mdash; 
And tumble&mdash;Blue&mdash;on me&mdash; 
It Was A Grave, Yet Bore No Stone 
 
It was a Grave, yet bore no Stone 
Enclosed 'twas not of Rail 
A Consciousness its Acre, and 
It held a Human Soul. 
Entombed by whom, for what offence 
If Home or Foreign born&mdash; 
Had I the curiosity 
'Twere not appeased of men 
Till Resurrection, I must guess 
Denied the small desire 
A Rose upon its Ridge to sow 
Or take away a Briar. 
It Was Given To Me By The Gods 
 
It was given to me by the Gods&mdash; 
When I was a little Girl&mdash; 
They given us Presents most&mdash;you know&mdash; 
When we are new&mdash;and small. 
I kept it in my Hand&mdash; 
I never put it down&mdash; 
I did not dare to eat&mdash;or sleep&mdash; 
For fear it would be gone&mdash; 
I heard such words as "Rich"&mdash; 
When hurrying to school&mdash; 
From lips at Corners of the Streets&mdash; 
And wrestled with a smile. 
Rich! 'Twas Myself&mdash;was rich&mdash; 
To take the name of Gold&mdash; 
And Gold to own&mdash;in solid Bars&mdash; 
The Difference&mdash;made me bold&mdash; 
It Was Not Death, For I Stood Up, 
It was not death, for I stood up, 
And all the dead lie down; 
It was not night, for all the bells 
Put out their tongues, for noon. 
It was not frost, for on my flesh 
I felt siroccos crawl,-Nor 
fire, for just my marble feet 
Could keep a chancel cool. 
And yet it tasted like them all; 
The figures I have seen 
Set orderly, for burial, 
Reminded me of mine, 
As if my life were shaven 
And fitted to a frame, 
And could not breathe without a key; 
And 't was like midnight, some, 
When everything that ticked has stopped, 
And space stares, all around, 
Or grisly frosts, first autumn morns, 
Repeal the beating ground. 
But most like chaos,--stopless, cool,-Without 
a chance or spar,-Or 
even a report of land 
To justify despair. 
It Was Too Late For Man 
 
It was too late for Man&mdash; 
But early, yet, for God&mdash; 
Creation&mdash;impotent to help&mdash; 
But Prayer&mdash;remained&mdash;Our Side&mdash; 
How excellent the Heaven&mdash; 
When Earth&mdash;cannot be had&mdash; 
How hospitable&mdash;then&mdash;the face 
Of our Old Neighbor&mdash;God&mdash; 
It Will Be Summer—eventually 
 
It will be Summer—eventually. 
Ladies—with parasols— 
Sauntering Gentlemen—with Canes— 
And little Girls—with Dolls— 
Will tint the pallid landscape— 
As 'twere a bright Bouquet— 
Thro' drifted deep, in Parian— 
The Village lies—today— 
The Lilacs—bending many a year— 
Will sway with purple load— 
The Bees—will not despise the tune— 
Their Forefathers—have hummed— 
The Wild Rose—redden in the Bog— 
The Aster—on the Hill 
Her everlasting fashion—set— 
And Covenant Gentians—frill— 
Till Summer folds her miracle— 
As Women—do—their Gown— 
Of Priests—adjust the Symbols— 
When Sacrament—is done— 
It Would Have Starved A Gnat 
 
It would have starved a Gnat&mdash; 
To live so small as I&mdash; 
And yet I was a living Child&mdash; 
With Food's necessity 
Upon me&mdash;like a Claw&mdash; 
I could no more remove 
Than I could coax a Leech away&mdash; 
Or make a Dragon&mdash;move&mdash; 
Not like the Gnat&mdash;had I&mdash; 
The privilege to fly 
And seek a Dinner for myself&mdash; 
How mightier He&mdash;than I&mdash; 
Nor like Himself&mdash;the Art 
Upon the Window Pane 
To gad my little Being out&mdash; 
And not begin&mdash;again&mdash; 
It Would Never Be Common—more—i Said 
 
It would never be Common—more—I said— 
Difference—had begun— 
Many a bitterness—had been— 
But that old sort—was done— 
Or—if it sometime—showed—as 'twill— 
Upon the Downiest—Morn— 
Such bliss—had I—for all the years— 
'Twould give an Easier—pain— 
I'd so much joy—I told it—Red— 
Upon my simple Cheek— 
I felt it publish—in my Eye— 
'Twas needless—any speak— 
I walked—as wings—my body bore— 
The feet—I former used— 
Unnecessary—now to me— 
As boots—would be—to Birds— 
I put my pleasure all abroad— 
I dealth a word of Gold 
To every Creature—that I met— 
And Dowered—all the World— 
When—suddenly—my Riches shrank— 
A Goblin—drank my Dew— 
My Palaces—dropped tenantless— 
Myself—was beggared—too— 
I clutched at sounds— 
I groped at shapes— 
I touched the tops of Films— 
I felt the Wilderness roll back 
Along my Golden lines— 
The Sackcloth—hangs upon the nail— 
The Frock I used to wear— 
But where my moment of Brocade— 
My—drop—of India? 
It's All I Have To Bring Today 
 
It's all I have to bring today&mdash; 
This, and my heart beside&mdash; 
This, and my heart, and all the fields&mdash; 
And all the meadows wide&mdash; 
Be sure you count&mdash;should I forget 
Some one the sum could tell&mdash; 
This, and my heart, and all the Bees 
Which in the Clover dwell. 
It's Coming—the Postponeless Creature 
 
It's coming—the postponeless Creature— 
It gains the Block—and now—it gains the Door— 
Chooses its latch, from all the other fastenings— 
Enters—with a "You know Me—Sir"? 
Simple Salute—and certain Recognition— 
Bold—were it Enemy—Brief—were it friend— 
Dresses each House in Crape, and Icicle— 
And carries one—out of it—to God— 
It's Easy To Invent A Life 
 
It's easy to invent a Life&mdash; 
God does it&mdash;every Day&mdash; 
Creation&mdash;but the Gambol 
Of His Authority&mdash; 
It's easy to efface it&mdash; 
The thrifty Deity 
Could scarce afford Eternity 
To Spontaneity&mdash; 
The Perished Patterns murmur&mdash; 
But His Perturbless Plan 
Proceed&mdash;inserting Here&mdash;a Sun&mdash; 
There&mdash;leaving out a Man&mdash; 
It's Like The Light, -
It's like the light, -A 
fashionless delight 
It's like the bee, -A 
dateless melody. 
It's like the woods,
 Private like breeze, 
Phraseless, yet it stirs 
The proudest trees. 
It's like the morning, -Best 
when it's done, -The 
everlasting clocks 
Chime noon. 
It's Such A Little Thing To Weep 
 
It's such a little thing to weep&mdash; 
So short a thing to sigh&mdash; 
And yet&mdash;by Trades&mdash;the size of these 
We men and women die! 
It's Thoughts—and Just One Heart 
It's thoughts—and just One Heart— 
And Old Sunshine—about— 
Make frugal—Ones—Content— 
And two or three—for Company— 
Upon a Holiday— 
Crowded—as Sacrament— 
Books—when the Unit— 
Spare the Tenant—long eno'— 
A Picture—if it Care— 
Itself—a Gallery too rare— 
For needing more— 
Flowers—to keep the Eyes—from going awkward— 
When it snows— 
A Bird—if they—prefer— 
Though Winter fire—sing clear as Plover— 
To our—ear— 
A Landscape—not so great 
To suffocate the Eye— 
A Hill—perhaps— 
Perhaps—the profile of a Mill 
Turned by the Wind— 
Tho' such—are luxuries— 
It's thoughts—and just two Heart— 
And Heaven—about— 
At least—a Counterfeit— 
We would not have Correct— 
And Immortality—can be almost— 
Not quite—Content— 
I'Ve Heard An Organ Talk, Sometimes 
 
I've heard an Organ talk, sometimes 
In a Cathedral Aisle, 
And understood no word it said&mdash; 
Yet held my breath, the while&mdash; 
And risen up&mdash;and gone away, 
A more Berdardine Girl&mdash; 
Yet&mdash;know not what was done to me 
In that old Chapel Aisle. 
I'Ve Known A Heaven, Like A Tent 
 
I've known a Heaven, like a Tent&mdash; 
To wrap its shining Yards&mdash; 
Pluck up its stakes, and disappear&mdash; 
Without the sound of Boards 
Or Rip of Nail&mdash;Or Carpenter&mdash; 
But just the miles of Stare&mdash; 
That signalize a Show's Retreat&mdash; 
In North America&mdash; 
No Trace&mdash;no Figment of the Thing 
That dazzled, Yesterday, 
No Ring&mdash;no Marvel&mdash; 
Men, and Feats&mdash; 
Dissolved as utterly&mdash; 
As Bird's far Navigation 
Discloses just a Hue&mdash; 
A plash of Oars, a Gaiety&mdash; 
Then swallowed up, of View. 
I'Ve None To Tell Me To But Thee 
 
I've none to tell me to but Thee 
So when Thou failest, nobody. 
It was a little tie&mdash; 
It just held Two, nor those it held 
Since Somewhere thy sweet Face has spilled 
Beyond my Boundary&mdash; 
If things were opposite&mdash;and Me 
And Me it were&mdash;that ebbed from Thee 
On some unanswering Shore&mdash; 
Would'st Thou seek so&mdash;just say 
That I the Answer may pursue 
Unto the lips it eddied through&mdash; 
So&mdash;overtaking Thee&mdash; 
I'Ve Nothing Else—to Bring, You Know 
 
I've nothing else—to bring, You know— 
So I keep bringing These— 
Just as the Night keeps fetching Stars 
To our familiar eyes— 
Maybe, we shouldn't mind them— 
Unless they didn't come— 
Then—maybe, it would puzzle us 
To find our way Home— 
I'Ve Seen A Dying Eye 
 
I've seen a Dying Eye 
Run round and round a Room&mdash; 
In search of Something&mdash;as it seemed&mdash; 
Then Cloudier become&mdash; 
And then&mdash;obscure with Fog&mdash; 
And then&mdash;be soldered down 
Without disclosing what it be 
'Twere blessed to have seen&mdash; 
Jesus! Thy Crucifix 
 
Jesus! thy Crucifix 
Enable thee to guess 
The smaller size! 
Jesus! thy second face 
Mind thee in Paradise 
Of ours! 
Joy To Have Merited The Pain 
 
Joy to have merited the Pain&mdash; 
To merit the Release&mdash; 
Joy to have perished every step&mdash; 
To Compass Paradise&mdash; 
Pardon&mdash;to look upon thy face&mdash; 
With these old fashioned Eyes&mdash; 
Better than new&mdash;could be&mdash;for that&mdash; 
Though bought in Paradise&mdash; 
Because they looked on thee before&mdash; 
And thou hast looked on them&mdash; 
Prove Me&mdash;My Hazel Witnesses 
The features are the same&mdash; 
So fleet thou wert, when present&mdash; 
So infinite&mdash;when gone&mdash; 
An Orient's Apparition&mdash; 
Remanded of the Morn&mdash; 
The Height I recollect&mdash; 
'Twas even with the Hills&mdash; 
The Depth upon my Soul was notched&mdash; 
As Floods&mdash;on Whites of Wheels&mdash; 
To Haunt&mdash;till Time have dropped 
His last Decade away, 
And Haunting actualize&mdash;to last 
At least&mdash;Eternity&mdash; 
Judgment is justest 
Judgment is justest 
When the Judged, 
His action laid away, 
Divested is of every Disk 
But his sincerity. 
Honor is then the safest hue 
In a posthumous Sun Not 
any color will endure 
That scrutiny can burn. 
Just As He Spoke It From His Hands 
 
Just as He spoke it from his Hands 
This Edifice remain&mdash; 
A Turret more, a Turret less 
Dishonor his Design&mdash; 
According as his skill prefer 
It perish, or endure&mdash; 
Content, soe'er, it ornament 
His absent character. 
Just Lost, When I Was Saved! 
 
Just lost, when I was saved! 
Just felt the world go by! 
Just girt me for the onset with Eternity, 
When breath blew back, 
And on the other side 
I heard recede the disappointed tide! 
Therefore, as One returned, I feel 
Odd secrets of the line to tell! 
Some Sailor, skirting foreign shores&mdash; 
Some pale Reporter, from the awful doors 
Before the Seal! 
Next time, to stay! 
Next time, the things to see 
By Ear unheard, 
Unscrutinized by Eye&mdash; 
Next time, to tarry, 
While the Ages steal&mdash; 
Slow tramp the Centuries, 
And the Cycles wheel! 
Kill Your Balm—and Its Odors Bless You 
 
Kill your Balm—and its Odors bless you— 
Bare your Jessamine—to the storm— 
And she will fling her maddest perfume— 
Haply—your Summer night to Charm— 
Stab the Bird—that built in your bosom— 
Oh, could you catch her last Refrain— 
Bubble! "forgive"—"Some better"—Bubble! 
"Carol for Him—when I am gone"! 
Knows How To Forget! 
 
Knows how to forget! 
But could It teach it? 
Easiest of Arts, they say 
When one learn how 
Dull Hearts have died 
In the Acquisition 
Sacrificed for Science 
Is common, though, now&mdash; 
I went to School 
But was not wiser 
Globe did not teach it 
Nor Logarithm Show 
"How to forget"! 
Say&mdash;some&mdash;Philosopher! 
Ah, to be erudite 
Enough to know! 
Is it in a Book? 
So, I could buy it&mdash; 
Is it like a Planet? 
Telescopes would know&mdash; 
If it be invention 
It must have a Patent.

Let me not mar that perfect Dream 
Let me not mar that perfect Dream 
By an Auroral stain 
But so adjust my daily Night 
That it will come again. 
Not when we know, the Power accosts The 
Garment of Surprise 
Was all our timid Mother wore 
At Home -in Paradise. 
Let Us Play Yesterday 
 
Let Us play Yesterday&mdash; 
I&mdash;the Girl at school&mdash; 
You&mdash;and Eternity&mdash;the 
Untold Tale&mdash; 
Easing my famine 
At my Lexicon&mdash; 
Logarithm&mdash;had I&mdash;for Drink&mdash; 
'Twas a dry Wine&mdash; 
Somewhat different&mdash;must be&mdash; 
Dreams tint the Sleep&mdash; 
Cunning Reds of Morning

Still at the Egg-life&mdash; 
Chafing the Shell&mdash; 
When you troubled the Ellipse&mdash; 
And the Bird fell&mdash; 
Manacles be dim&mdash;they say&mdash; 
To the new Free&mdash; 
Liberty&mdash;Commoner&mdash; 
Never could&mdash;to me&mdash; 
'Twas my last gratitude 
When I slept&mdash;at night&mdash; 
'Twas the first Miracle 
Let in&mdash;with Light&mdash; 
Can the Lark resume the Shell&mdash; 
Easier&mdash;for the Sky&mdash; 
Wouldn't Bonds hurt more 
Than Yesterday? 
Wouldn't Dungeons sorer frate 
On the Man&mdash;free&mdash; 
Just long enough to taste&mdash; 
Then&mdash;doomed new&mdash; 
God of the Manacle 
As of the Free&mdash;

Life—is What We Make Of It 
 
Life—is what we make of it— 
Death—we do not know— 
Christ's acquaintance with Him 
Justify Him—though— 
He—would trust no stranger— 
Other—could betray— 
Just His own endorsement— 
That—sufficeth Me— 
All the other Distance 
He hath traversed first— 
No New Mile remaineth— 
Far as Paradise— 
His sure foot preceding— 
Tender Pioneer— 
Base must be the Coward 
Dare not venture—now— 
Light Is Sufficient To Itself 
 
Light is sufficient to itself&mdash; 
If Others want to see 
It can be had on Window Panes 
Some Hours in the Day. 
But not for Compensation&mdash; 
It holds as large a Glow 
To Squirrel in the Himmaleh 
Precisely, as to you. 
Lightly Stepped A Yellow Star 
Lightly stepped a yellow star 
To its lofty place Loosed 
the Moon her silver hat 
From her lustral Face All 
of Evening softly lit 
As an Astral Hall Father, 
I observed to Heaven, 
You are punctual. 
Like Brooms of Steel 
Like Brooms of Steel 
The Snow and Wind 
Had swept the Winter Street The 
House was hooked 
The Sun sent out 
Faint Deputies of Heat Where 
rode the Bird 
The Silence tied 
His ample -plodding Steed 
The Apple in the Cellar snug 
Was all the one that played. 
Like Eyes That Looked On Wastes 
 
Like eyes that looked on Wastes&mdash; 
Incredulous of Ought 
But Blank&mdash;and steady Wilderness&mdash; 
Diversified by Night&mdash; 
Just Infinites of Nought&mdash; 
As far as it could see&mdash; 
So looked the face I looked upon&mdash; 
So looked itself&mdash;on Me&mdash; 
I offered it no Help&mdash; 
Because the Cause was Mine&mdash; 
The Misery a Compact 
As hopeless&mdash;as divine&mdash; 
Neither&mdash;would be absolved&mdash; 
Neither would be a Queen 
Without the Other&mdash;Therefore&mdash; 
We perish&mdash;tho' We reign&mdash; 
Like Flowers, That Heard The News Of Dews 
 
Like Flowers, that heard the news of Dews, 
But never deemed the dripping prize 
Awaited their&mdash;low Brows&mdash; 
Or Bees&mdash;that thought the Summer's name 
Some rumor of Delirium, 
No Summer&mdash;could&mdash;for Them&mdash; 
Or Arctic Creatures, dimly stirred&mdash; 
By Tropic Hint&mdash;some Travelled Bird 
Imported to the Wood&mdash; 
Or Wind's bright signal to the Ear&mdash; 
Making that homely, and severe, 
Contented, known, before&mdash; 
The Heaven&mdash;unexpected come, 
To Lives that thought the Worshipping 
A too presumptuous Psalm&mdash; 
Like Her The Saints Retire 
 
Like her the Saints retire, 
In their Chapeaux of fire, 
Martial as she! 
Like her the Evenings steal 
Purple and Cochineal 
After the Day! 
"Departed"&mdash;both&mdash;they say! 
i.e. gathered away, 
Not found, 
Argues the Aster still&mdash; 
Reasons the Daffodil 
Profound! 
Like Mighty Foot Lights—burned The Red 
 
Like Mighty Foot Lights—burned the Red 
At Bases of the Trees— 
The far Theatricals of Day 
Exhibiting—to These— 
'Twas Universe—that did applaud— 
While Chiefest—of the Crowd— 
Enabled by his Royal Dress— 
Myself distinguished God— 
Like Some Old Fashioned Miracle 
 
Like Some Old fashioned Miracle 
When Summertime is done&mdash; 
Seems Summer's Recollection 
And the Affairs of June 
As infinite Tradition 
As Cinderella's Bays&mdash; 
Or Little John&mdash;of Lincoln Green&mdash; 
Or Blue Beard's Galleries&mdash; 
Her Bees have a fictitious Hum&mdash; 
Her Blossoms, like a Dream&mdash; 
Elate us&mdash;till we almost weep&mdash; 
So plausible&mdash;they seem&mdash; 
Her Memories like Strains&mdash;Review&mdash; 
When Orchestra is dumb&mdash; 
The Violin in Baize replaced&mdash; 
And Ear&mdash;and Heaven&mdash;numb&mdash; 
Like Trains Of Cars On Tracks Of Plush 
Like trains of cars on tracks of plush 
I hear the level bee: 
A jar across the flowers goes, 
Their velvet masonry 
Withstands until the sweet assault 
Their chivalry consumes, 
While he, victorious, tilts away 
To vanquish other blooms. 
His feet are shod with gauze, 
His helmet is of gold; 
His breast, a single onyx 
With chrysoprase, inlaid. 
His labor is a chant, 
His idleness a tune; 
Oh, for a bee's experience 
Of clovers and of noon! 
Lives He In Any Other World 
Lives he in any other world 
My faith cannot reply 
Before it was imperative 
'Twas all distinct to me 
Longing is like the Seed 
Longing is like the Seed 
That wrestles in the Ground, 
Believing if it intercede 
It shall at length be found. 
The Hour, and the Clime Each 
Circumstance unknown, 
What Constancy must be achieved 
Before it see the Sun!

Low At My Problem Bending 
 
Low at my problem bending, 
Another problem comes&mdash; 
Larger than mine&mdash;Serener&mdash; 
Involving statelier sums. 
I check my busy pencil, 
My figures file away. 
Wherefore, my baffled fingers 
They perplexity? 
Luck is not chance 
Luck is not chance 
It's Toil 
Fortune's expensive smile 
Is earned 
The Father of the Mine 
Is that old-fashioned Coin 
We spurned 
Make Me A Picture Of The Sun 
 
Make me a picture of the sun&mdash; 
So I can hang it in my room&mdash; 
And make believe I'm getting warm 
When others call it "Day"! 
Draw me a Robin&mdash;on a stem&mdash; 
So I am hearing him, I'll dream, 
And when the Orchards stop their tune&mdash; 
Put my pretense&mdash;away&mdash; 
Say if it's really&mdash;warm at noon&mdash; 
Whether it's Buttercups&mdash;that "skim"&mdash; 
Or Butterflies&mdash;that "bloom"? 
Then&mdash;skip&mdash;the frost&mdash;upon the lea&mdash; 
And skip the Russet&mdash;on the tree&mdash; 
Let's play those&mdash;never come! 
Mama Never Forgets Her Birds 
 
Mama never forgets her birds, 
Though in another tree&mdash; 
She looks down just as often 
And just as tenderly 
As when her little mortal nest 
With cunning care she wove&mdash; 
If either of her "sparrows fall," 
She "notices," above. 
Many A Phrase Has The English Language 
 
Many a phrase has the English language&mdash; 
I have heard but one&mdash; 
Low as the laughter of the Cricket, 
Loud, as the Thunder's Tongue&mdash; 
Murmuring, like old Caspian Choirs, 
When the Tide's a' lull&mdash; 
Saying itself in new infection&mdash; 
Like a Whippoorwill&mdash; 
Breaking in bright Orthography 
On my simple sleep&mdash; 
Thundering its Prospective&mdash; 
Till I stir, and weep&mdash; 
Not for the Sorrow, done me&mdash; 
But the push of Joy&mdash; 
Say it again, Saxton! 
Hush&mdash;Only to me! 
Many Cross The Rhine 
 
Many cross the Rhine

March is the Month of Expectation 
March is the Month of Expectation. 
The things we do not know The 
Persons of prognostication 
Are coming now We 
try to show becoming firmness But 
pompous Joy 
Betrays us, as his first Betrothal 
Betrays a Boy. 
May-Flower 
Pink, small, and punctual, 
Aromatic, low, 
Covert in April, 
Candid in May, 
Dear to the moss, 
Known by the knoll, 
Next to the robin 
In every human soul. 
Bold little beauty, 
Bedecked with thee, 
Nature forswears 
Antiquity. 
Me From Myself—to Banish 
 
Me from Myself—to banish— 
Had I Art— 
Impregnable my Fortress 
Unto All Heart— 
But since Myself—assault Me— 
How have I peace 
Except by subjugating 
Consciousness? 
And since We're mutual Monarch 
How this be 
Except by Abdication— 
Me—of Me? 
Me Prove It Now—whoever Doubt 
 
Me prove it now—Whoever doubt 
Me stop to prove it—now— 
Make haste—the Scruple! Death be scant 
For Opportunity— 
The River reaches to my feet— 
As yet—My Heart be dry— 
Oh Lover—Life could not convince— 
Might Death—enable Thee— 
The River reaches to My Breast— 
Still—still—My Hands above 
Proclaim with their remaining Might— 
Dost recognize the Love? 
The River reaches to my Mouth— 
Remember—when the Sea 
Swept by my searching eyes—the last— 
Themselves were quick—with Thee! 
Me! Come! My Dazzled Face 
Me! Come! My dazzled face 
In such a shining place! 
Me! Hear! My foreign ear 
The sounds of welcome near! 
The saints shall meet 
Our bashful feet. 
My holiday shall be 
That they remember me; 
My paradise, the fame 
That they pronounce my name. 
Me, Change! Me, Alter! 
 
Me, change! Me, alter! 
Then I will, when on the Everlasting Hill 
A Smaller Purple grows&mdash; 
At sunset, or a lesser glow 
Flickers upon Cordillera&mdash; 
At Day's superior close!

A full, and perfect time&mdash; 
The Summer closed upon itself 
In Consummated Bloom&mdash; 
The Corn, her furthest kernel filled 
Before the coming Flail&mdash; 
When These&mdash;leaned unto Perfectness&mdash; 
Through Haze of Burial&mdash; 
Mine enemy is growing old 
MINE enemy is growing old,	 
I have at last revenge.	 
The palate of the hate departs;	 
If any would avenge,	 
Let him be quick, the viand flits,	
It is a faded meat.	 
Anger as soon as fed is dead;	 
'T is starving makes it fat. 
Mine—by The Right Of The White Election! 
 
Mine—by the Right of the White Election! 
Mine—by the Royal Seal! 
Mine—by the Sign in the Scarlet prison— 
Bars—cannot conceal! 
Mine—here—in Vision—and in Veto! 
Mine—by the Grave's Repeal— 
Tilted—Confirmed— 
Delirious Charter! 
Mine—long as Ages steal! 
More Life—went Out—when He Went 
 
More Life—went out—when He went 
Than Ordinary Breath— 
Lit with a finer Phosphor— 
Requiring in the Quench— 
A Power of Renowned Cold, 
The Climate of the Grave 
A Temperature just adequate 
So Anthracite, to live— 
For some—an Ampler Zero— 
A Frost more needle keen 
Is necessary, to reduce 
The Ethiop within. 
Others—extinguish easier— 
A Gnat's minutest Fan 
Sufficient to obliterate 
A Tract of Citizen— 
Whose Peat lift—amply vivid— 
Ignores the solemn News 
That Popocatapel exists— 
Or Etna's Scarlets, Choose—

Morns Like These—we Parted 
 
Morns like these—we parted— 
Noons like these—she rose— 
Fluttering first—then firmer 
To her fair repose. 
Never did she lisp it— 
It was not for me— 
She—was mute from transport— 
I—from agony— 
Till—the evening nearing 
One the curtains drew— 
Quick! A Sharper rustling! 
And this linnet flew! 
Most She Touched Me By Her Muteness 
 
Most she touched me by her muteness&mdash; 
Most she won me by the way 
She presented her small figure&mdash; 
Plea itself&mdash;for Charity&mdash; 
Were a Crumb my whole possession&mdash; 
Were there famine in the land&mdash; 
Were it my resource from starving&mdash; 
Could I such a plea withstand&mdash; 
Not upon her knee to thank me 
Sank this Beggar from the Sky&mdash; 
But the Crumb partook&mdash;departed&mdash; 
And returned On High&mdash; 
I supposed&mdash;when sudden 
Such a Praise began 
'Twas as Space sat singing 
To herself&mdash;and men&mdash; 
'Twas the Winged Beggar&mdash; 
Afterward I learned 
To her Benefactor 
Making Gratitude

Musicians wrestle everywhere&mdash; 
All day&mdash;among the crowded air 
I hear the silver strife&mdash; 
And&mdash;walking&mdash;long before the morn&mdash; 
Such transport breaks upon the town 
I think it that "New Life"!

My Best Acquaintances Are Those 
 
My best Acquaintances are those 
With Whom I spoke no Word&mdash; 
The Stars that stated come to Town 
Esteemed Me never rude 
Although to their Celestial Call 
I failed to make reply&mdash; 
My constant&mdash;reverential Face 
Sufficient Courtesy. 
My Cocoon Tightens, Colors Tease 
MY cocoon tightens, colors tease,	 
I 'm feeling for the air;	 
A dim capacity for wings	 
Degrades the dress I wear.	 
A power of butterfly must be	 
The aptitude to fly,	 
Meadows of majesty concedes	 
And easy sweeps of sky.	 
So I must baffle at the hint	 
And cipher at the sign,	 
And make much blunder, if at last	 
I take the clew divine. 
My Eye Is Fuller Than My Vase 
 
My Eye is fuller than my vase&mdash; 
Her Cargo&mdash;is of Dew&mdash; 
And still&mdash;my Heart&mdash;my Eye outweighs&mdash; 
East India&mdash;for you! 
My Faith Is Larger Than The Hills 
 
My Faith is larger than the Hills&mdash; 
So when the Hills decay&mdash; 
My Faith must take the Purple Wheel 
To show the Sun the way&mdash; 
'Tis first He steps upon the Vane&mdash; 
And then&mdash;upon the Hill&mdash; 
And then abroad the World He go 
To do His Golden Will&mdash; 
And if His Yellow feet should miss&mdash; 
The Bird would not arise&mdash; 
The Flowers would slumber on their Stems&mdash; 
No Bells have Paradise&mdash; 
How dare I, therefore, stint a faith 
On which so vast depends&mdash; 
Lest Firmament should fail for me&mdash; 
The Rivet in the Bands 
My First Well Day—since Many Ill 
 
My first well Day—since many ill— 
I asked to go abroad, 
And take the Sunshine in my hands, 
And see the things in Pod— 
A 'blossom just when I went in 
To take my Chance with pain— 
Uncertain if myself, or He, 
Should prove the strongest One. 
The Summer deepened, while we strove— 
She put some flowers away— 
And Redder cheeked Ones—in their stead— 
A fond—illusive way— 
To cheat Herself, it seemed she tried— 
As if before a child 
To fade—Tomorrow—Rainbows held 
The Sepulchre, could hide. 
She dealt a fashion to the Nut— 
She tied the Hoods to Seeds— 
She dropped bright scraps of Tint, about— 
And left Brazilian Threads 
On every shoulder that she met— 
Then both her Hands of Haze 
Put up—to hide her parting Grace 
From our unfitted eyes. 
My loss, by sickness—Was it Loss? 
Or that Ethereal Gain 
One earns by measuring the Grave— 
Then—measuring the Sun— 
My Friend Attacks My Friend! 
 
My friend attacks my friend! 
Oh Battle picturesque! 
Then I turn Soldier too, 
And he turns Satirist! 
How martial is this place! 
Had I a mighty gun 
I think I'd shoot the human race 
And then to glory run! 
My Friend Must Be A Bird 
 
My friend must be a Bird— 
Because it flies! 
Mortal, my friend must be, 
Because it dies! 
Barbs has it, like a Bee! 
Ah, curious friend! 
Thou puzzlest me! 
My Garden—like The Beach 
My Garden—like the Beach— 
Denotes there be—a Sea— 
That's Summer— 
Such as These—the Pearls 
She fetches—such as Me 
My Life Closed Twice 
My life closed twice before its close-It 
yet remains to see 
If Immortality unveil 
A third event to me 
So huge, so hopeless to conceive 
As these that twice befell. 
Parting is all we know of heaven, 
And all we need of hell. 
My Life Had Stood 
My life had stood--a Loaded Gun-In 
Corners--till a Day 
The Owner passed--identified-And 
carried Me away-
And now We roam in Sovereign Woods-And 
now We hunt the Doe-And 
every time I speak for Him-The 
Mountains straight reply-
And do I smile, such cordial light 
Upon the Valley glow-It 
is as a Vesuvian face 
Had let its pleasure through-
And when at Night--Our good Day done-I 
guard My Master's Head-'
Tis better than the Eider-Duck's 
Deep Pillow--to have shared-
To foe of His--I'm deadly foe-None 
stir the second time-On 
whom I lay a Yellow Eye-Or 
an emphatic Thumb-
Though I than He--may longer live 
He longer must--than I-For 
I have but the power to kill, 
Without--the power to die-
My Nosegays Are For Captives; 
My nosegays are for captives; 
Dim, long-expectant eyes, 
Fingers denied the plucking, 
Patient till paradise. 
To such, if they should whisper 
Of morning and the moor, 
They bear no other errand, 
And I, no other prayer. 
My Period Had Come For Prayer 
 
My period had come for Prayer&mdash; 
No other Art&mdash;would do&mdash; 
My Tactics missed a rudiment&mdash; 
Creator&mdash;Was it you? 
God grows above&mdash;so those who pray 
Horizons&mdash;must ascend&mdash; 
And so I stepped upon the North 
To see this Curious Friend&mdash; 
His House was not&mdash;no sign had He&mdash; 
By Chimney&mdash;nor by Door 
Could I infer his Residence&mdash; 
Vast Prairies of Air 
Unbroken by a Settler&mdash; 
Were all that I could see&mdash; 
Infinitude&mdash;Had'st Thou no Face 
That I might look on Thee? 
The Silence condescended&mdash; 
Creation stopped&mdash;for Me&mdash; 
But awed beyond my errand&mdash; 
I worshipped&mdash;did not "pray"&mdash; 
My Portion Is Defeat—today 
 
My Portion is Defeat—today— 
A paler luck than Victory— 
Less Paeans—fewer Bells— 
The Drums don't follow Me—with tunes— 
Defeat—a somewhat slower—means— 
More Arduous than Balls— 
'Tis populous with Bone and stain— 
And Men too straight to stoop again—, 
And Piles of solid Moan— 
And Chips of Blank—in Boyish Eyes— 
And scraps of Prayer— 
And Death's surprise, 
Stamped visible—in Stone— 
There's somewhat prouder, over there— 
The Trumpets tell it to the Air— 
How different Victory 
To Him who has it—and the One 
Who to have had it, would have been 
Contender—to die— 
My Reward For Being, Was This 
 
My Reward for Being, was This. 
My premium&mdash;My Bliss&mdash; 
An Admiralty, less&mdash; 
A Sceptre&mdash;penniless&mdash; 
And Realms&mdash;just Dross&mdash; 
When Thrones accost my Hands&mdash; 
With "Me, Miss, Me"&mdash; 
I'll unroll Thee&mdash; 
Dominions dowerless&mdash;beside this Grace&mdash; 
Election&mdash;Vote&mdash; 
The Ballots of Eternity, will show just that. 
My River Runs To Thee 
My River runs to thee— 
Blue Sea! Wilt welcome me? 
My River wait reply— 
Oh Sea—look graciously— 
I'll fetch thee Brooks 
From spotted nooks— 
Say—Sea—Take Me! 
My Soul—accused Me—and I Quailed 
 
My Soul—accused me—And I quailed— 
As Tongue of Diamond had reviled 
All else accused me—and I smiled— 
My Soul—that Morning—was My friend— 
Her favor—is the best Disdain 
Toward Artifice of Time—or Men— 
But Her Disdain—'twere lighter bear 
A finger of Enamelled Fire— 
My Wheel Is In The Dark 
 
My wheel is in the dark! 
I cannot see a spoke 
Yet know its dripping feet 
Go round and round. 
My foot is on the Tide! 
An unfrequented road&mdash; 
Yet have all roads 
A clearing at the end&mdash; 
Some have resigned the Loom&mdash; 
Some in the busy tomb 
Find quaint employ&mdash; 
Some with new&mdash;stately feet&mdash; 
Pass royal through the gate&mdash; 
Flinging the problem back 
At you and I! 
My Worthiness Is All My Doubt 
 
My Worthiness is all my Doubt&mdash; 
His Merit&mdash;all my fear&mdash; 
Contrasting which, my quality 
Do lowlier&mdash;appear&mdash; 
Lest I should insufficient prove 
For His beloved Need&mdash; 
The Chiefest Apprehension 
Upon my thronging Mind&mdash; 
'Tis true&mdash;that Deity to stoop 
Inherently incline&mdash; 
For nothing higher than Itself 
Itself can rest upon&mdash; 
So I&mdash;the undivine abode 
Of His Elect Content&mdash; 
Conform my Soul&mdash;as 'twere a Church, 
Unto Her Sacrament&mdash; 
Myself Was Formed—a Carpenter 
 
Myself was formed—a Carpenter— 
An unpretending time 
My Plane—and I, together wrought 
Before a Builder came— 
To measure our attainments— 
Had we the Art of Boards 
Sufficiently developed—He'd hire us 
At Halves— 
My Tools took Human—Faces— 
The Bench, where we had toiled— 
Against the Man—persuaded— 
We—Temples build—I said— 
Nature And God—i Neither Knew 
 
Nature and God—I neither knew 
Yet Both so well knew me 
They startled, like Executors 
Of My identity. 
Yet Neither told—that I could learn— 
My Secret as secure 
As Herschel's private interest 
Or Mercury's affair— 
Nature Is What We See— 
"Nature" is what we see— 
The Hill—the Afternoon— 
Squirrel—Eclipse—the Bumble bee— 
Nay—Nature is Heaven— 
Nature is what we hear— 
The Bobolink—the Sea— 
Thunder—the Cricket— 
Nay—Nature is Harmony— 
Nature is what we know— 
Yet have no art to say— 
So impotent Our Wisdom is 
To her Simplicity. 
Nature Rarer Uses Yellow 
Nature rarer uses yellow 
Than another hue; 
Saves she all of that for sunsets,-Prodigal 
of blue, 
Spending scarlet like a woman, 
Yellow she affords 
Only scantly and selectly, 
Like a lover's words. 
Nature The Gentlest Mother Is 
Nature the gentlest mother is, 
Impatient of no child, 
The feeblest of the waywardest. 
Her admonition mild 
In forest and the hill 
By traveller be heard, 
Restraining rampant squirrel 
Or too impetuous bird. 
How fair her conversation 
A summer afternoon, 
Her household her assembly; 
And when the sun go down, 
Her voice among the aisles 
Incite the timid prayer 
Of the minutest cricket, 
The most unworthy flower. 
When all the children sleep, 
She turns as long away 
As will suffice tolight her lamps, 
Then bending from the sky 
With infinite affection 
An infiniter care, 
Her golden finger on her lip, 
Wills silence everywhere.

Nature—sometimes Sears A Sapling 
 
Nature—sometimes sears a Sapling— 
Sometimes—scalps a Tree— 
Her Green People recollect it 
When they do not die— 
Fainter Leaves—to Further Seasons—

We—who have the Souls— 
Die oftener—Not so vitally— 
Never For Society 
 
Never for Society 
He shall seek in vain&mdash;

Neither introduction 
Need You&mdash;unto Him&mdash; 
New Feet Within My Garden Go 
 
New feet within my garden go&mdash; 
New fingers stir the sod&mdash; 
A Troubadour upon the Elm 
Betrays the solitude. 
New children play upon the green&mdash; 
New Weary sleep below&mdash; 
And still the pensive Spring returns&mdash; 
And still the punctual snow!

No Man can compass a Despair&mdash; 
As round a Goalless Road 
No faster than a Mile at once 
The Traveller proceed&mdash; 
Unconscious of the Width&mdash; 
Unconscious that the Sun

So accurate the One

No Matter—now—sweet 
 
No matter—now—Sweet— 
But when I'm Earl— 
Won't you wish you'd spoken 
To that dull Girl? 
Trivial a Word—just— 
Trivial—a Smile— 
But won't you wish you'd spared one 
When I'm Earl? 
I shan't need it—then— 
Crests—will do— 
Eagles on my Buckles— 
On my Belt—too— 
Ermine—my familiar Gown— 
Say—Sweet—then 
Won't you wish you'd smiled—just— 
Me upon? 
No Notice Gave She, But A Change 
 
No Notice gave She, but a Change&mdash; 
No Message, but a Sigh&mdash; 
For Whom, the Time did not suffice 
That She should specify. 
She was not warm, though Summer shone 
Nor scrupulous of cold 
Though Rime by Rime, the steady Frost 
Upon Her Bosom piled&mdash; 
Of shrinking ways&mdash;she did not fright 
Though all the Village looked&mdash; 
But held Her gravity aloft&mdash; 
And met the gaze&mdash;direct&mdash; 
And when adjusted like a Seed 
In careful fitted Ground 
Unto the Everlasting Spring 
And hindered but a Mound 
Her Warm return, if so she chose&mdash; 
And We&mdash;imploring drew&mdash; 
Removed our invitation by 
As Some She never knew&mdash; 
No Other Can Reduce 
 
No Other can reduce

Nobody knows this little Rose&mdash; 
It might a pilgrim be

And lift it up to thee. 
Only a Bee will miss it&mdash; 
Only a Butterfly, 
Hastening from far journey&mdash;

Not any sunny tone 
Not any sunny tone 
From any fervent zone 
Find entrance there Better 
a grave of Balm 
Toward human nature's home And 
Robins near Than 
a stupendous Tomb 
Proclaiming to the Gloom 
How dead we are 
Not In This World To See His Face 
Not in this world to see his face 
Sounds long, until I read the place 
Where this is said to be 
But just the primer to a life 
Unopened, rare, upon the shelf, 
Clasped yet to him and me. 
And yet, my primer suits me so 
I would not choose a book to know 
Than that, be sweeter wise; 
Might some one else so learned be. 
And leave me just my A B C, 
Himself could have the skies. 
Not Probable—the Barest Chance 
 
Not probable—The barest Chance— 
A smile too few—a word too much 
And far from Heaven as the Rest— 
The Soul so close on Paradise— 
What if the Bird from journey far— 
Confused by Sweets—as Mortals—are— 
Forget the secret of His wing 
And perish—but a Bough between— 
Oh, Groping feet— 
Oh Phantom Queen! 
Not Sickness stains the Brave,

But an adjourning Heart 
Not That We Did, Shall Be The Test 
 
Not that We did, shall be the test 
When Act and Will are done 
But what Our Lord infers We would 
Had We diviner been&mdash; 
Not with a club, the Heart is broken 
Not with a club, the Heart is broken,	 
Nor with a stone;	 
A whip, so small you could not see it,	 
I've known	 
To lash the magic creature 
Till it fell,	 
Yet that whip's name too noble	 
Then to tell.	 
Magnanimous of bird	 
By boy descried, 
To sing unto the stone	 
Of which it died. 
Next: The Only News I know 
Of All The Souls That Stand Create 
Of all the souls that stand create 
I have elected one. 
When sense from spirit files away, 
And subterfuge is done; 
When that which is and that which was 
Apart, intrinsic, stand, 
And this brief tragedy of flesh 
Is shifted like a sand; 
When figures show their royal front 
And mists are carved sway,-Behold 
the atom I Feferred 
To all the lists of clay! 
Of All The Sounds Despatched Abroad 
 
Of all the Sounds despatched abroad, 
There's not a Charge to me 
Like that old measure in the Boughs&mdash; 
That phraseless Melody&mdash; 
The Wind does&mdash;working like a Hand, 
Whose fingers Comb the Sky&mdash; 
Then quiver down&mdash;with tufts of Tune&mdash; 
Permitted Gods, and me&mdash; 
Inheritance, it is, to us&mdash; 
Beyond the Art to Earn&mdash; 
Beyond the trait to take away 
By Robber, since the Gain 
Is gotten not of fingers&mdash; 
And inner than the Bone&mdash; 
Hid golden, for the whole of Days, 
And even in the Urn, 
I cannot vouch the merry Dust 
Do not arise and play 
In some odd fashion of its own, 
Some quainter Holiday, 
When Winds go round and round in Bands&mdash; 
And thrum upon the door, 
And Birds take places, overhead, 
To bear them Orchestra. 
I crave Him grace of Summer Boughs, 
If such an Outcast be&mdash; 
Who never heard that fleshless Chant&mdash; 
Rise&mdash;solemn&mdash;on the Tree, 
As if some Caravan of Sound 
Off Deserts, in the Sky, 
Had parted Rank, 
Then knit, and swept&mdash; 
In Seamless Company&mdash; 
Of Being Is A Bird 
 
Of Being is a Bird 
The likest to the Down 
An Easy Breeze do put afloat 
The General Heavens&mdash;upon&mdash; 
It soars&mdash;and shifts&mdash;and whirls&mdash; 
And measures with the Clouds 
In easy&mdash;even&mdash;dazzling pace&mdash; 
No different the Birds&mdash; 
Except a Wake of Music 
Accompany their feet&mdash; 
As did the Down emit a Tune&mdash; 
For Ecstasy&mdash;of it 
Of Bronze—and Blaze 
 
Of Bronze—and Blaze— 
The North—Tonight— 
So adequate—it forms— 
So preconcerted with itself— 
So distant—to alarms— 
And Unconcern so sovereign 
To Universe, or me— 
Infects my simple spirit 
With Taints of Majesty— 
Till I take vaster attitudes— 
And strut upon my stem— 
Disdaining Men, and Oxygen, 
For Arrogance of them— 
My Splendors, are Menagerie— 
But their Completeless Show 
Will entertain the Centuries 
When I, am long ago, 
An Island in dishonored Grass— 
Whom none but Beetles—know. 
Of Brussels—it Was Not 
Of Brussels—it was not— 
Of Kidderminster? Nay— 
The Winds did buy it of the Woods— 
They—sold it unto me 
It was a gentle price— 
The poorest—could afford— 
It was within the frugal purse 
Of Beggar—or of Bird— 
Of small and spicy Yards— 
In hue—a mellow Dun— 
Of Sunshine—and of Sere—Composed— 
But, principally—of Sun— 
The Wind—unrolled it fast— 
And spread it on the Ground— 
Upholsterer of the Pines—is He— 
Upholsterer—of the Pond— 
Of Consciousness, Her Awful Mate 
 
Of Consciousness, her awful Mate 
The Soul cannot be rid&mdash; 
As easy the secreting her 
Behind the Eyes of God. 
The deepest hid is sighted first 
And scant to Him the Crowd&mdash; 
What triple Lenses burn upon 
The Escapade from God&mdash; 
Of Course—i Prayed 
 
Of Course—I prayed— 
And did God Care? 
He cared as much as on the Air 
A Bird—had stamped her foot— 
And cried "Give Me"— 
My Reason—Life— 
I had not had—but for Yourself— 
'Twere better Charity 
To leave me in the Atom's Tomb— 
Merry, and Nought, and gay, and numb— 
Than this smart Misery. 
Of Nearness To Her Sundered Things 
 
Of nearness to her sundered Things 
The Soul has special times&mdash; 
When Dimness&mdash;looks the Oddity&mdash; 
Distinctness&mdash;easy&mdash;seems&mdash; 
The Shapes we buried, dwell about, 
Familiar, in the Rooms&mdash; 
Untarnished by the Sepulchre, 
The Mouldering Playmate comes&mdash; 
In just the Jacket that he wore&mdash; 
Long buttoned in the Mold 
Since we&mdash;old mornings, Children&mdash;played&mdash; 
Divided&mdash;by a world&mdash; 
The Grave yields back her Robberies&mdash; 
The Years, our pilfered Things&mdash; 
Bright Knots of Apparitions 
Salute us, with their wings&mdash; 
As we&mdash;it were&mdash;that perished&mdash; 
Themself&mdash;had just remained till we rejoin them&mdash; 
And 'twas they, and not ourself 
That mourned. 
Of Silken Speech And Specious Shoe 
 
Of Silken Speech and Specious Shoe 
A Traitor is the Bee 
His service to the newest Grace 
Present continually 
His Suit a chance 
His Troth a Term 
Protracted as the Breeze 
Continual Ban propoundeth He 
Continual Divorce. 
Of so divine a Loss 
Of so divine a Loss 
We enter but the Gain, 
Indemnity for Loneliness 
That such a Bliss has been. 
Of Tolling Bell I Ask The Cause? 
 
Of Tolling Bell I ask the cause? 
"A Soul has gone to Heaven" 
I'm answered in a lonesome tone&mdash; 
Is Heaven then a Prison? 
That Bells should ring till all should know 
A Soul had gone to Heaven 
Would seem to me the more the way 
A Good News should be given. 
Of Tribulation, These Are They 
 
Of Tribulation, these are They, 
Denoted by the White&mdash; 
The Spangled Gowns, a lesser Rank 
Of Victors&mdash;designate&mdash; 
All these&mdash;did conquer&mdash; 
But the ones who overcame most times&mdash; 
Wear nothing commoner than Snow&mdash; 
No Ornament, but Palms&mdash; 
Surrender&mdash;is a sort unknown&mdash; 
On this superior soil&mdash; 
Defeat&mdash;an outgrown Anguish&mdash; 
Remembered, as the Mile 
Our panting Ankle barely passed&mdash; 
When Night devoured the Road&mdash; 
But we&mdash;stood whispering in the House&mdash; 
And all we said&mdash;was "Saved"! 
Of Yellow was the outer Sky 
Nature rarer uses Yellow 
Than another Hue. 
Saves she all of that for Sunsets 
Prodigal of Blue 
Spending Scarlet, like a Woman 
Yellow she affords 
Only scantly and selectly 
Like a Lover's Words. 
Oh Shadow on the Grass 
Oh Shadow on the Grass, 
Art thou a Step or not? 
Go make thee fair my Candidate 
My nominated Heart Oh 
Shadow on the Grass 
While I delay to guess 
Some other thou wilt consecrate Oh 
Unelected Face 
On A Columnar Self 
 
On a Columnar Self&mdash; 
How ample to rely 
In Tumult&mdash;or Extremity&mdash; 
How good the Certainty 
That Lever cannot pry&mdash; 
And Wedge cannot divide 
Conviction&mdash;That Granitic Base&mdash; 
Though None be on our Side&mdash; 
Suffice Us&mdash;for a Crowd&mdash; 
Ourself&mdash;and Rectitude&mdash; 
And that Assembly&mdash;not far off 
From furthest Spirit&mdash;God&mdash; 
On my volcano grows the Grass 
On my volcano grows the Grass 
A meditative spot An 
acre for a Bird to choose 
Would be the General thought 
How red the Fire rocks below How 
insecure the sod 
Did I disclose 
Would populate with awe my solitude. 
On Such A Night, Or Such A Night 
 
On such a night, or such a night, 
Would anybody care 
If such a little figure 
Slipped quiet from its chair&mdash; 
So quiet&mdash;Oh how quiet, 
That nobody might know 
But that the little figure 
Rocked softer&mdash;to and fro&mdash; 
On such a dawn, or such a dawn&mdash; 
Would anybody sigh 
That such a little figure 
Too sound asleep did lie 
For Chanticleer to wake it&mdash; 
Or stirring house below&mdash; 
Or giddy bird in orchard&mdash; 
Or early task to do? 
There was a little figure plump 
For every little knoll&mdash; 
Busy needles, and spools of thread&mdash; 
And trudging feet from school&mdash; 
Playmates, and holidays, and nuts&mdash; 
And visions vast and small&mdash; 
Strange that the feet so precious charged 
Should reach so small a goal! 
On That Dear Frame The Years Had Worn 
 
On that dear Frame the Years had worn 
Yet precious as the House 
In which We first experienced Light 
The Witnessing, to Us&mdash; 
Precious! It was conceiveless fair 
As Hands the Grave had grimed 
Should softly place within our own 
Denying that they died. 
On This Long Storm The Rainbow Rose 
 
On this long storm the Rainbow rose&mdash; 
On this late Morn&mdash;the Sun&mdash; 
The clouds&mdash;like listless Elephants&mdash; 
Horizons&mdash;straggled down&mdash; 
The Birds rose smiling, in their nests&mdash; 
The gales&mdash;indeed&mdash;were done&mdash; 
Alas, how heedless were the eyes&mdash; 
On whom the summer shone! 
The quiet nonchalance of death&mdash; 
No Daybreak&mdash;can bestir&mdash; 
The slow&mdash;Archangel's syllables 
Must awaken her! 
On This Wondrous Sea 
 
On this wondrous sea 
Sailing silently, 
Ho! Pilot, ho! 
Knowest thou the shore 
Where no breakers roar&mdash; 
Where the storm is o'er? 
In the peaceful west 
Many the sails at rest&mdash; 
The anchors fast&mdash; 
Thither I pilot thee&mdash; 
Land Ho! Eternity! 
Ashore at last! 
Once More, My Now Bewildered Dove 
 
Once more, my now bewildered Dove 
Bestirs her puzzled wings 
Once more her mistress, on the deep 
Her troubled question flings&mdash; 
Thrice to the floating casement 
The Patriarch's bird returned, 
Courage! My brave Columba! 
There may yet be Land! 
One And One—are One 
 
One and One—are One— 
Two—be finished using— 
Well enough for Schools— 
But for Minor Choosing— 
Life—just—or Death— 
Or the Everlasting— 
More—would be too vast 
For the Soul's Comprising— 
One Anguish—in A Crowd 
 
One Anguish—in a Crowd— 
A Minor thing—it sounds— 
And yet, unto the single Doe 
Attempted of the Hounds 
'Tis Terror as consummate 
As Legions of Alarm 
Did leap, full flanked, upon the Host— 
'Tis Units—make the Swarm— 
A Small Leech—on the Vitals— 
The sliver, in the Lung— 
The Bung out—of an Artery— 
Are scarce accounted—Harms— 
Yet might—by relation 
To that Repealless thing— 
A Being—impotent to end— 
When once it has begun— 
One Blessing Had I Than The Rest 
 
One Blessing had I than the rest 
So larger to my Eyes 
That I stopped gauging&mdash;satisfied&mdash; 
For this enchanted size&mdash; 
It was the limit of my Dream&mdash; 
The focus of my Prayer&mdash; 
A perfect&mdash;paralyzing Bliss&mdash; 
Contented as Despair&mdash; 
I knew no more of Want&mdash;or Cold&mdash; 
Phantasms both become 
For this new Value in the Soul&mdash; 
Supremest Earthly Sum&mdash; 
The Heaven below the Heaven above&mdash; 
Obscured with ruddier Blue&mdash; 
Life's Latitudes leant over&mdash;full&mdash; 
The Judgment perished&mdash;too&mdash; 
Why Bliss so scantily disburse&mdash; 
Why Paradise defer&mdash; 
Why Floods be served to Us&mdash;in Bowls&mdash; 
I speculate no more&mdash; 
One Crucifixion Is Recorded—only 
 
One Crucifixion is recorded—only— 
How many be 
Is not affirmed of Mathematics— 
Or History— 
One Calvary—exhibited to Stranger— 
As many be 
As persons—or Peninsulas— 
Gethsemane— 
Is but a Province—in the Being's Centre— 
Judea— 
For Journey—or Crusade's Achieving— 
Too near— 
Our Lord—indeed—made Compound Witness— 
And yet— 
There's newer—nearer Crucifixion 
Than That— 
One Day Is There Of The Series 
 
One Day is there of the Series 
Termed Thanksgiving Day. 
Celebrated part at Table 
Part in Memory. 
Neither Patriarch nor Pussy 
I dissect the Play 
Seems it to my Hooded thinking 
Reflex Holiday. 
Had there been no sharp Subtraction 
From the early Sum&mdash; 
Not an Acre or a Caption 
Where was once a Room&mdash; 
Not a Mention, whose small Pebble 
Wrinkled any Sea, 
Unto Such, were such Assembly 
'Twere Thanksgiving Day. 
One Dignity Delays For All 
 
One dignity delays for all&mdash; 
One mitred Afternoon&mdash; 
None can avoid this purple&mdash; 
None evade this Crown! 
Coach, it insures, and footmen&mdash; 
Chamber, and state, and throng&mdash; 
Bells, also, in the village 
As we ride grand along! 
What dignified Attendants! 
What service when we pause! 
How loyally at parting 
Their hundred hats they raise! 
Her pomp surpassing ermine 
When simple You, and I, 
Present our meek escutheon 
And claim the rank to die! 
One Life Of So Much Consequence! 
 
One Life of so much Consequence! 
Yet I&mdash;for it&mdash;would pay&mdash; 
My Soul's entire income&mdash; 
In ceaseless&mdash;salary&mdash; 
One Pearl&mdash;to me&mdash;so signal&mdash; 
That I would instant dive&mdash; 
Although&mdash;I knew&mdash;to take it&mdash; 
Would cost me&mdash;just a life! 
The Sea is full&mdash;I know it! 
That&mdash;does not blur my Gem! 
It burns&mdash;distinct from all the row&mdash; 
Intact&mdash;in Diadem! 
The life is thick&mdash;I know it! 
Yet&mdash;not so dense a crowd&mdash; 
But Monarchs&mdash;are perceptible&mdash; 
Far down the dustiest Road! 
One Need Not Be A Chamber To Be Haunted, 
One need not be a chamber to be haunted, 
One need not be a house; 
The brain has corridors surpassing 
Material place. 
Far safer, of a midnight meeting 
External ghost, 
Than an interior confronting 
That whiter host. 
Far safer through an Abbey gallop, 
The stones achase, 
Than, moonless, one's own self encounter 
In lonesome place. 
Ourself, behind ourself concealed, 
Should startle most; 
Assassin, hid in our apartment, 
Be horror's least. 
The prudent carries a revolver, 
He bolts the door, 
O'erlooking a superior spectre 
More near. 
One Sister Have I In Our House 
 
One Sister have I in our house, 
And one, a hedge away. 
There's only one recorded, 
But both belong to me. 
One came the road that I came&mdash; 
And wore my last year's gown&mdash; 
The other, as a bird her nest, 
Builded our hearts among. 
She did not sing as we did&mdash; 
It was a different tune&mdash; 
Herself to her a music 
As Bumble bee of June. 
Today is far from Childhood&mdash; 
But up and down the hills 
I held her hand the tighter&mdash; 
Which shortened all the miles&mdash; 
And still her hum 
The years among, 
Deceives the Butterfly; 
Still in her Eye 
The Violets lie 
Mouldered this many May. 
I spilt the dew&mdash; 
But took the morn&mdash; 
I chose this single star 
From out the wide night's numbers&mdash; 
Sue - forevermore! 
One Year Ago—jots What? 
 
One Year ago—jots what? 
God—spell the word! I—can't— 
Was't Grace? Not that— 
Was't Glory? That—will do— 
Spell slower—Glory— 
Such Anniversary shall be— 
Sometimes—not often—in Eternity— 
When farther Parted, than the Common Woe— 
Look—feed upon each other's faces—so— 
In doubtful meal, if it be possible 
Their Banquet's true— 
I tasted—careless—then— 
I did not know the Wine 
Came once a World—Did you? 
Oh, had you told me so— 
This Thirst would blister—easier—now— 
You said it hurt you—most— 
Mine—was an Acorn's Breast— 
And could not know how fondness grew 
In Shaggier Vest— 
Perhaps—I couldn't— 
But, had you looked in— 
A Giant—eye to eye with you, had been— 
No Acorn—then— 
So—Twelve months ago— 
We breathed— 
Then dropped the Air— 
Which bore it best? 
Was this—the patientest— 
Because it was a Child, you know— 
And could not value—Air? 
If to be "Elder"—mean most pain— 
I'm old enough, today, I'm certain—then— 
As old as thee—how soon? 
One—Birthday more—or Ten? 
Let me—choose! 
Ah, Sir, None! 
Only A Shrine, But Mine 
 
Only a Shrine, but Mine&mdash; 
I made the Taper shine&mdash; 
Madonna dim, to whom all Feet may come, 
Regard a Nun&mdash; 
Thou knowest every Woe&mdash; 
Needless to tell thee&mdash;so&mdash; 
But can'st thou do 
The Grace next to it&mdash;heal? 
That looks a harder skill to us&mdash; 
Still&mdash;just as easy, if it be thy Will 
To thee&mdash;Grant me&mdash; 
Thou knowest, though, so Why tell thee? 
Only God—detect The Sorrow 
 
Only God—detect the Sorrow— 
Only God— 
The Jehovahs—are no Babblers— 
Unto God— 
God the Son—Confide it— 
Still secure— 
God the Spirit's Honor— 
Just as sure— 
Our Journey Had Advanced; 
Our journey had advanced; 
Our feet were almost come 
To that odd fork in Being's road, 
Eternity by term. 
Our pace took sudden awe, 
Our feet reluctant led. 
Before were cities, but between, 
The forest of the dead. 
Retreat was out of hope,-Behind, 
a sealed route, 
Eternity's white flag before, 
And God at every gate. 
Our Little Kinsmen—after Rain 
 
Our little Kinsmen—after Rain 
In plenty may be seen, 
A Pink and Pulpy multitude 
The tepid Ground upon. 
A needless life, it seemed to me 
Until a little Bird 
As to a Hospitality 
Advanced and breakfasted. 
As I of He, so God of Me 
I pondered, may have judged, 
And left the little Angle Worm 
With Modesties enlarged. 
Our Lives Are Swiss 
Our lives are Swiss -So 
still -- so Cool -Till 
some odd afternoon 
The Alps neglect their Curtains 
And we look farther on! 
Italy stands the other side! 
While like a guard between -The 
solemn Alps -The 
siren Alps 
Forever intervene! 
Our Share Of Night To Bear 
 
Our share of night to bear&mdash; 
Our share of morning&mdash; 
Our blank in bliss to fill 
Our blank in scorning&mdash; 
Here a star, and there a star, 
Some lose their way! 
Here a mist, and there a mist, 
Afterwards&mdash;Day! 
Ourselves Were Wed One Summer—dear 
 
Ourselves were wed one summer—dear— 
Your Vision—was in June— 
And when Your little Lifetime failed, 
I wearied—too—of mine— 
And overtaken in the Dark— 
Where You had put me down— 
By Some one carrying a Light— 
I—too—received the Sign. 
'Tis true—Our Futures different lay— 
Your Cottage—faced the sun— 
While Oceans—and the North must be— 
On every side of mine 
'Tis true, Your Garden led the Bloom, 
For mine—in Frosts—was sown— 
And yet, one Summer, we were Queens— 
But You—were crowned in June— 
Out Of Sight? What Of That? 
 
Out of sight? What of that? 
See the Bird&mdash;reach it! 
Curve by Curve&mdash;Sweep by Sweep&mdash; 
Round the Steep Air&mdash; 
Danger! What is that to Her? 
Better 'tis to fail&mdash;there&mdash; 
Than debate&mdash;here&mdash; 
Blue is Blue&mdash;the World through&mdash; 
Amber&mdash;Amber&mdash;Dew&mdash;Dew&mdash; 
Seek&mdash;Friend&mdash;and see&mdash; 
Heaven is shy of Earth&mdash;that's all&mdash; 
Bashful Heaven&mdash;thy Lovers small&mdash; 
Hide&mdash;too&mdash;from thee&mdash; 
Over And Over, Like A Tune 
 
Over and over, like a Tune&mdash; 
The Recollection plays&mdash; 
Drums off the Phantom Battlements 
Cornets of Paradise&mdash; 
Snatches, from Baptized Generations&mdash; 
Cadences too grand 
But for the Justified Processions 
At the Lord's Right hand. 
Over The Fence 
 
Over the fence&mdash; 
Strawberries&mdash;grow&mdash; 
Over the fence&mdash; 
I could climb&mdash;if I tried, I know&mdash; 
Berries are nice! 
But&mdash;if I stained my Apron&mdash; 
God would certainly scold! 
Oh, dear,&mdash;I guess if He were a Boy&mdash; 
He'd&mdash;climb&mdash;if He could! 
Pain 
Pain--has an Element of Blank-It 
cannot recollect 
When it begun--or if there were 
A time when it was not-
It has no Future--but itself-Its 
Infinite Contain 
Its Past--enlightened to perceive 
New Periods--of Pain. 
Pain Has An Element 
Pain has an element of blank; 
It cannot recollect 
When it began, or if there were 
A day when it was not. 
It has no future but itself, 
Its infinite realms contain 
Its past, enlightened to perceive 
New periods of pain.

Pain&Mdash;Expands The Time 
 
Pain&mdash;expands the Time&mdash; 
Ages coil within 
The minute Circumference 
Of a single Brain&mdash; 
Pain contracts&mdash;the Time&mdash; 
Occupied with Shot 
Gamuts of Eternities 
Are as they were not&mdash; 
Papa Above! 
 
Papa above! 
Regard a Mouse 
O'erpowered by the Cat! 
Reserve within thy kingdom 
A "Mansion" for the Rat! 
Snug in seraphic Cupboards 
To nibble all the day 
While unsuspecting Cycles 
Wheel solemnly away! 
Part Five: The Single Hound 
THE LARGEST fire ever known	 
Occurs each afternoon,	 
Discovered is without surprise,	 
Proceeds without concern:	 
Consumes, and no report to men,	
An Occidental town,	 
Rebuilt another morning	 
To be again burned down. 
Partake As Doth The Bee 
 
Partake as doth the Bee, 
Abstemiously. 
The Rose is an Estate&mdash; 
In Sicily. 
Patience—has A Quiet Outer 
 
Patience—has a quiet Outer— 
Patience—Look within— 
Is an Insect's futile forces 
Infinites—between— 
'Scaping one—against the other 
Fruitlesser to fling— 
Patience—is the Smile's exertion 
Through the quivering— 
Peace Is A Fiction Of Our Faith 
 
Peace is a fiction of our Faith&mdash; 
The Bells a Winter Night 
Bearing the Neighbor out of Sound 
That never did alight. 
Perhaps I Asked Too Large 
Perhaps I asked too large -I 
take -- no less than skies -For 
Earths, grow thick as 
Berries, in my native town -
My Basked holds -- just -- Firmaments -Those 
-- dangle easy -- on my arm, 
But smaller bundles -- Cram. 
Perhaps You Think Me Stooping 
 
Perhaps you think me stooping 
I'm not ashamed of that 
Christ&mdash;stooped until He touched the Grave&mdash; 
Do those at Sacrament 
Commemorative Dishonor 
Or love annealed of love 
Until it bend as low as Death 
Redignified, above? 
Perhaps You'D Like To Buy A Flower 
 
Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower, 
But I could never sell&mdash; 
If you would like to borrow, 
Until the Daffodil 
Unties her yellow Bonnet 
Beneath the village door, 
Until the Bees, from Clover rows 
Their Hock, and Sherry, draw, 
Why, I will lend until just then, 
But not an hour more! 
Pigmy Seraphs—gone Astray 
 
Pigmy seraphs—gone astray— 
Velvet people from Vevay— 
Balles from some lost summer day— 
Bees exclusive Coterie— 
Paris could not lay the fold 
Belted down with Emerald— 
Venice could not show a check 
Of a tint so lustrous meek— 
Never such an Ambuscade 
As of briar and leaf displayed 
For my little damask maid— 
I had rather wear her grace 
Than an Earl's distinguished face— 
I had rather dwell like her 
Than be "Duke of Exeter"— 
Royalty enough for me 
To subdue the Bumblebee. 
Poor Little Heart! 
 
Poor little Heart! 
Did they forget thee? 
Then dinna care! Then dinna care! 
Proud little Heart! 
Did they forsake thee? 
Be debonnaire! Be debonnaire! 
Frail little Heart! 
I would not break thee&mdash; 
Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me? 
Gay little Heart&mdash; 
Like Morning Glory! 
Wind and Sun&mdash;wilt thee array! 
Portraits Are To Daily Faces 
 
Portraits are to daily faces 
As an Evening West, 
To a fine, pedantic sunshine&mdash; 
In a satin Vest! 
Praise it -'tis dead 
Praise it -'tis dead It 
cannot glow Warm 
this inclement Ear 
With the encomium it earned 
Since it was gathered here Invest 
this alabaster Zest 
In the Delights of Dust Remitted 
-since it flitted it 
In recusance august. 
Prayer Is The Little Implement 
 
Prayer is the little implement 
Through which Men reach 
Where Presence&mdash;is denied them. 
They fling their Speech 
By means of it&mdash;in God's Ear&mdash; 
If then He hear&mdash; 
This sums the Apparatus 
Comprised in Prayer&mdash; 
Precious To Me—she Still Shall Be 
 
Precious to Me—She still shall be— 
Though She forget the name I bear— 
The fashion of the Gown I wear— 
The very Color of My Hair— 
So like the Meadows—now— 
I dared to show a Tress of Theirs 
If haply—She might not despise 
A Buttercup's Array— 
I know the Whole—obscures the Part— 
The fraction—that appeased the Heart 
Till Number's Empery— 
Remembered—as the Millner's flower 
When Summer's Everlasting Dower— 
Confronts the dazzled Bee. 
Presentiment Is That Long Shadow On The Lawn 
Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn 
Indicative that suns go down; 
The notice to the startled grass 
That darkness is about to pass. 
Promise This—when You Be Dying 
 
Promise This—When You be Dying— 
Some shall summon Me— 
Mine belong Your latest Sighing— 
Mine—to Belt Your Eye— 
Not with Coins—though they be Minted 
From an Emperor's Hand— 
Be my lips—the only Buckle 
Your low Eyes—demand— 
Mine to stay—when all have wandered— 
To devise once more 
If the Life be too surrendered— 
Life of Mine—restore— 
Poured like this—My Whole Libation— 
Just that You should see 
Bliss of Death—Life's Bliss extol thro' 
Imitating You— 
Mine—to guard Your Narrow Precinct— 
To seduce the Sun 
Longest on Your South, to linger, 
Largest Dews of Morn 
To demand, in Your low favor 
Lest the Jealous Grass 
Greener lean—Or fonder cluster 
Round some other face— 
Mine to supplicate Madonna— 
If Madonna be 
Could behold so far a Creature— 
Christ—omitted—Me— 
Just to follow Your dear future— 
Ne'er so far behind— 
For My Heaven— 
Had I not been 
Most enough—denied? 
Proud Of My Broken Heart 
Proud of my broken heart, since thou didst break it. 
Proud of the pain, I did not feel? till thee. 
Proud of my night, since thou, with moons, dos't shake it. 
Not to partake thy passion, -my humility 
Thou can'st not boast, like Jesus, drunken without companion 
Was the strong cup of anguish brewed for the Nazarene 
Thou can'st not pierce tradition with the peerless puncture, 
See! I usurped thy crucifix to honor mine!

Put Up My Lute! 
 
Put up my lute! 
What of&mdash;my Music! 
Since the sole ear I cared to charm&mdash; 
Passive&mdash;as Granite&mdash;laps My Music&mdash; 
Sobbing&mdash;will suit&mdash;as well as psalm! 
Would but the "Memnon" of the Desert&mdash; 
Teach me the strain 
That vanquished Him&mdash; 
When He&mdash;surrendered to the Sunrise&mdash; 
Maybe&mdash;that&mdash;would awaken&mdash;them! 
Read—sweet—how Others—strove 
 
Read—Sweet—how others—strove— 
Till we—are stouter— 
What they—renounced— 
Till we—are less afraid— 
How many times they—bore the faithful witness— 
Till we—are helped— 
As if a Kingdom—cared! 
Read then—of faith— 
That shone above the fagot— 
Clear strains of Hymn 
The River could not drown— 
Brave names of Men— 
And Celestial Women— 
Passed out—of Record 
Into—Renown! 
Rearrange a 'Wife's' affection! 
Rearrange a 'Wife's' affection! 
When they dislocate my Brain! 
Amputate my freckled Bosom! 
Make me bearded like a man! 
Blush, my spirit, in thy Fastness Blush, 
my unacknowledged clay Seven 
years of troth have taught thee 
More than Wifehood every may! 
Love that never leaped its socket Trust 
entrenched in narrow pain Constancy 
thro' fire -awarded Anguish 
-bare of anodyne! 
Burden -borne so far triumphant None 
suspect me of the crown, 
For I wear the 'Thorns' till Sunset Then 
-my Diadem put on. 
Big my Secret but it's bandaged It 
will never get away 
Till the Day its Weary Keeper 
Leads it through the Grave to thee.

Rehearsal to Ourselves

Affords a Bliss like Murder&mdash;

Rest At Night 
 
Rest at Night 
The Sun from shining, 
Nature&mdash;and some Men&mdash; 
Rest at Noon&mdash;some Men&mdash; 
While Nature 
And the Sun&mdash;go on&mdash; 
Reverse Cannot Befall 
 
Reverse cannot befall 
That fine Prosperity 
Whose Sources are interior&mdash; 
As soon&mdash;Adversity 
A Diamond&mdash;overtake 
In far&mdash;Bolivian Ground&mdash; 
Misfortune hath no implement 
Could mar it&mdash;if it found&mdash; 
Revolution is the Pod 
Revolution is the Pod 
Systems rattle from 
When the Winds of Will are stirred 
Excellent is Bloom 
But except its Russet Base 
Every Summer be 
The Entomber of itself, 
So of Liberty 
Left inactive on the Stalk 
All its Purple fled 
Revolution shakes it for 
Test if it be dead. 
Ribbons Of The Year 
 
Ribbons of the Year&mdash; 
Multitude Brocade&mdash; 
Worn to Nature's Party once 
Then, as flung aside 
As a faded Bead 
Or a Wrinkled Pearl 
Who shall charge the Vanity 
Of the Maker's Girl? 
Robbed By Death—but That Was Easy 
 
Robbed by Death—but that was easy— 
To the failing Eye 
I could hold the latest Glowing— 
Robbed by Liberty 
For Her Jugular Defences— 
This, too, I endured— 
Hint of Glory—it afforded— 
For the Brave Beloved— 
Fraud of Distance—Fraud of Danger, 
Fraud of Death—to bear— 
It is Bounty—to Suspense's 
Vague Calamity— 
Stalking our entire Possession 
On a Hair's result— 
Then—seesawing—coolly—on it— 
Trying if it split— 
Safe In Their Alabaster Chambers, 
Safe in their alabaster chambers, 
Untouched by morning and untouched by noon, 
Sleep the meek members of the resurrection, 
Rafter of satin, and roof of stone. 
Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine; 
Babbles the bee in a stolid ear; 
Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadences, -Ah, 
what sagacity perished here! 
Grand go the years in the crescent above them; 
Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row, 
Diadems drop and Doges surrender, 
Soundless as dots on a disk of snow. 
Said Death To Passion 
Said Death to Passion 
'Give of thine an Acre unto me.' 
Said Passion, through contracting Breaths 
'A Thousand Times Thee Nay.' 
Bore Death from Passion 
All His East 
He -sovereign as the Sun 
Resituated in the West 
And the Debate was done. 
Savior! I'Ve No One Else To Tell 
 
Savior! I've no one else to tell&mdash; 
And so I trouble thee. 
I am the one forgot thee so&mdash; 
Dost thou remember me? 
Nor, for myself, I came so far&mdash; 
That were the little load&mdash; 
I brought thee the imperial Heart 
I had not strength to hold&mdash; 
The Heart I carried in my own&mdash; 
Till mine too heavy grew&mdash; 
Yet&mdash;strangest&mdash;heavier since it went&mdash; 
Is it too large for you? 
September's Baccalaureate 
September's Baccalaureate 
A combination is 
Of Crickets -Crows -and Retrospects 
And a dissembling Breeze 
That hints without assuming An 
Innuendo sear 
That makes the Heart put up its Fun 
And turn Philosopher. 
Severer Service Of Myself 
 
Severer Service of myself 
I&mdash;hastened to demand 
To fill the awful Vacuum 
Your life had left behind&mdash; 
I worried Nature with my Wheels 
When Hers had ceased to run&mdash; 
When she had put away Her Work 
My own had just begun. 
I strove to weary Brain and Bone&mdash; 
To harass to fatigue 
The glittering Retinue of nerves&mdash; 
Vitality to clog 
To some dull comfort Those obtain 
Who put a Head away 
They knew the Hair to&mdash; 
And forget the color of the Day&mdash; 
Affliction would not be appeased&mdash; 
The Darkness braced as firm 
As all my stratagem had been 
The Midnight to confirm&mdash; 
No Drug for Consciousness&mdash;can be&mdash; 
Alternative to die 
Is Nature's only Pharmacy 
For Being's Malady&mdash; 
Sexton! My Master's Sleeping Here 
 
Sexton! My Master's sleeping here. 
Pray lead me to his bed! 
I came to build the Bird's nest, 
And sow the Early seed&mdash; 
That when the snow creeps slowly 
From off his chamber door&mdash; 
Daisies point the way there&mdash; 
And the Troubadour. 
Shall I take thee, the Poet said 
Shall I take thee, the Poet said 
To the propounded word? 
Be stationed with the Candidates 
Till I have finer tried— 
The Poet searched Philology 
And when about to ring 
For the suspended Candidate 
There came unsummoned in— 
That portion of the Vision 
The Word applied to fill 
Not unto nomination 
The Cherubim reveal— 
She Bore It Till The Simple Veins 
 
She bore it till the simple veins 
Traced azure on her hand&mdash; 
Til pleading, round her quiet eyes 
The purple Crayons stand. 
Till Daffodils had come and gone 
I cannot tell the sum, 
And then she ceased to bear it&mdash; 
And with the Saints sat down. 
No more her patient figure 
At twilight soft to meet&mdash; 
No more her timid bonnet 
Upon the village street&mdash; 
But Crowns instead, and Courtiers&mdash; 
And in the midst so fair, 
Whose but her shy&mdash;immortal face 
Of whom we're whispering here? 
She could not live upon the Past 
She could not live upon the Past 
The Present did not know her 
And so she sought this sweet at last 
And nature gently owned her 
The mother that has not a knell 
for either Duke or Robin 
She Dealt Her Pretty Words Like Blades 
 
She dealt her pretty words like Blades&mdash; 
How glittering they shone&mdash; 
And every One unbared a Nerve 
Or wantoned with a Bone&mdash; 
She never deemed&mdash;she hurt&mdash; 
That&mdash;is not Steel's Affair&mdash; 
A vulgar grimace in the Flesh&mdash; 
How ill the Creatures bear&mdash; 
To Ache is human&mdash;not polite&mdash; 
The Film upon the eye 
Mortality's old Custom&mdash; 
Just locking up&mdash;to Die. 
She Died At Play 
 
She died at play, 
Gambolled away 
Her lease of spotted hours, 
Then sank as gaily as a Turn 
Upon a Couch of flowers. 
Her ghost strolled softly o'er the hill 
Yesterday, and Today, 
Her vestments as the silver fleece&mdash; 
Her countenance as spray. 
She Died—this Was The Way She Died 
 
She died—this was the way she died. 
And when her breath was done 
Took up her simple wardrobe 
And started for the sun. 
Her little figure at the gate 
The Angels must have spied, 
Since I could never find her 
Upon the mortal side. 
She Dwelleth In The Ground 
 
She dwelleth in the Ground&mdash; 
Where Daffodils&mdash;abide&mdash; 
Her Maker&mdash;Her Metropolis&mdash; 
The Universe&mdash;Her Maid&mdash; 
To fetch Her Grace&mdash;and Hue&mdash; 
And Fairness&mdash;and Renown&mdash; 
The Firmament's&mdash;To Pluck Her&mdash; 
And fetch Her Thee&mdash;be mine&mdash; 
She Hideth Her The Last 
 
She hideth Her the last&mdash; 
And is the first, to rise&mdash; 
Her Night doth hardly recompense 
The Closing of Her eyes&mdash; 
She doth Her Purple Work&mdash; 
And putteth Her away 
In low Apartments in the Sod As 
worthily as We. 
To imitate her life 
As impotent would be 
As make of Our imperfect Mints, 
The Julep&mdash;of the Bee&mdash; 
She Lay As If At Play 
 
She lay as if at play 
Her life had leaped away&mdash; 
Intending to return&mdash; 
But not so soon&mdash; 
Her merry Arms, half dropt&mdash; 
As if for lull of sport&mdash; 
An instant had forgot&mdash; 
The Trick to start&mdash; 
Her dancing Eyes&mdash;ajar&mdash; 
As if their Owner were 
Still sparkling through 
For fun&mdash;at you&mdash; 
Her Morning at the door&mdash; 
Devising, I am sure&mdash; 
To force her sleep&mdash; 
So light&mdash;so deep&mdash; 
She Rose To His Requirement 
 
She rose to His Requirement&mdash;dropt 
The Playthings of Her Life 
To take the honorable Work 
Of Woman, and of Wife&mdash; 
If ought She missed in Her new Day, 
Of Amplitude, or Awe&mdash; 
Or first Prospective&mdash;Or the Gold 
In using, wear away, 
It lay unmentioned&mdash;as the Sea 
Develop Pearl, and Weed, 
But only to Himself&mdash;be known 
The Fathoms they abide&mdash; 
She Slept Beneath A Tree 
 
She slept beneath a tree&mdash; 
Remembered but by me. 
I touched her Cradle mute&mdash; 
She recognized the foot&mdash; 
Put on her carmine suit
 And see! 
She Sped As Petals Of A Rose 
 
She sped as Petals of a Rose 
Offended by the Wind&mdash; 
A frail Aristocrat of Time 
Indemnity to find&mdash; 
Leaving on nature&mdash;a Default 
As Cricket or as Bee&mdash; 
But Andes in the Bosoms where 
She had begun to lie&mdash; 
She Staked Her Feathers—gained An Arc 
 
She staked her Feathers—Gained an Arc— 
Debated—Rose again— 
This time—beyond the estimate 
Of Envy, or of Men— 
And now, among Circumference— 
Her steady Boat be seen— 
At home—among the Billows—As 
The Bough where she was born— 
She Sweeps With Many-Colored Brooms, 
She sweeps with many-colored brooms, 
And leaves the shreds behind; 
Oh, housewife in the evening west, 
Come back, and dust the pond! 
You dropped a purple ravelling in, 
You dropped an amber thread; 
And now you've littered all the East 
With duds of emerald! 
And still she plies her spotted brooms, 
And still the aprons fly, 
Till brooms fade softly into stars -And 
then I come away. 
She Went As Quiet As The Dew 
 
She went as quiet as the Dew 
From an Accustomed flower. 
Not like the Dew, did she return 
At the Accustomed hour! 
She dropt as softly as a star 
From out my summer's Eve&mdash; 
Less skillful than Le Verriere 
It's sorer to believe! 
Shells From The Coast Mistaking 
 
Shells from the Coast mistaking&mdash; 
I cherished them for All&mdash; 
Happening in After Ages 
To entertain a Pearl&mdash; 
Wherefore so late&mdash;I murmured&mdash; 
My need of Thee&mdash;be done&mdash; 
Therefore&mdash;the Pearl responded&mdash; 
My Period begin 
She's Happy, With A New Content 
 
She's happy, with a new Content&mdash; 
That feels to her&mdash;like Sacrament&mdash; 
She's busy&mdash;with an altered Care&mdash; 
As just apprenticed to the Air&mdash; 
She's tearful&mdash;if she weep at all&mdash; 
For blissful Causes&mdash;Most of all 
That Heaven permit so meek as her&mdash; 
To such a Fate&mdash;to Minister. 
Should You But Fail At—sea 
 
Should you but fail at—Sea— 
In sight of me— 
Or doomed lie— 
Next Sun—to die— 
Or rap—at Paradise—unheard 
I'd harass God 
Until he let you in! 
Sic Transit Gloria Mundi 
 
"Sic transit gloria mundi," 
"How doth the busy bee," 
"Dum vivimus vivamus," 
I stay mine enemy! 
Oh "veni, vidi, vici!" 
Oh caput cap-a-pie! 
And oh "memento mori" 
When I am far from thee! 
Hurrah for Peter Parley! 
Hurrah for Daniel Boone! 
Three cheers, sir, for the gentleman 
Who first observed the moon! 
Peter, put up the sunshine; 
Patti, arrange the stars; 
Tell Luna, tea is waiting, 
And call your brother Mars! 
Put down the apple, Adam, 
And come away with me, 
So shalt thou have a pippin 
From off my father's tree! 
I climb the "Hill of Science," 
I "view the landscape o'er;" 
Such transcendental prospect, 
I ne'er beheld before! 
Unto the Legislature 
My country bids me go; 
I'll take my india rubbers, 
In case the wind should blow! 
During my education, 
It was announced to me 
That gravitation, stumbling, 
Fell from an apple tree! 
The earth upon an axis 
Was once supposed to turn, 
By way of a gymnastic 
In honor of the sun! 
It was the brave Columbus, 
A sailing o'er the tide, 
Who notified the nations 
Of where I would reside! 
Mortality is fatal&mdash; 
Gentility is fine, 
Rascality, heroic, 
Insolvency, sublime! 
Our Fathers being weary, 
Laid down on Bunker Hill; 
And tho' full many a morning, 
Yet they are sleeping still,&mdash; 
The trumpet, sir, shall wake them, 
In dreams I see them rise, 
Each with a solemn musket 
A marching to the skies! 
A coward will remain, Sir, 
Until the fight is done; 
But an immortal hero 
Will take his hat, and run! 
Good bye, Sir, I am going; 
My country calleth me; 
Allow me, Sir, at parting, 
To wipe my weeping e'e. 
In token of our friendship 
Accept this "Bonnie Doon," 
And when the hand that plucked it 
Hath passed beyond the moon, 
The memory of my ashes 
Will consolation be; 
Then, farewell, Tuscarora, 
And farewell, Sir, to thee! 
Silence is all we dread 
Silence is all we dread. 
There's Ransom in a Voice But 
Silence is Infinity. 
Himself have not a face. 
Size Circumscribes—it Has No Room 
 
Size circumscribes—it has no room 
For petty furniture— 
The Giant tolerates no Gnat 
For Ease of Gianture— 
Repudiates it, all the more— 
Because intrinsic size 
Ignores the possibility 
Of Calumnies—or Flies. 
Sleep Is Supposed To Be 
 
Sleep is supposed to be 
By souls of sanity 
The shutting of the eye. 
Sleep is the station grand 
Down which, on either hand 
The hosts of witness stand! 
Morn is supposed to be 
By people of degree 
The breaking of the Day. 
Morning has not occurred! 
That shall Aurora be&mdash; 
East of Eternity&mdash; 
One with the banner gay&mdash; 
One in the red array&mdash; 
That is the break of Day! 
Smiling Back From Coronation 
 
Smiling back from Coronation 
May be Luxury&mdash; 
On the Heads that started with us&mdash; 
Being's Peasantry&mdash; 
Recognizing in Procession 
Ones We former knew&mdash; 
When Ourselves were also dusty&mdash; 
Centuries ago&mdash; 
Had the Triumph no Conviction 
Of how many be&mdash; 
Stimulated&mdash;by the Contrast&mdash; 
Unto Misery&mdash; 
Snow Beneath Whose Chilly Softness 
 
Snow beneath whose chilly softness 
Some that never lay 
Make their first Repose this Winter 
I admonish Thee 
Blanket Wealthier the Neighbor 
We so new bestow 
Than thine acclimated Creature 
Wilt Thou, Austere Snow? 
Snow Flakes 
I counted till they danced so 
Their slippers leaped the town, 
And then I took a pencil 
To note the rebels down. 
And then they grew so jolly 
I did resign the prig, 
And ten of my once stately toes 
Are marshalled for a jig! 
So Bashful When I Spied Her! 
 
So bashful when I spied her! 
So pretty&mdash;so ashamed! 
So hidden in her leaflets 
Lest anybody find&mdash; 
So breathless till I passed here&mdash; 
So helpless when I turned 
And bore her struggling, blushing, 
Her simple haunts beyond! 
For whom I robbed the Dingle&mdash; 
For whom I betrayed the Dell&mdash; 
Many, will doubtless ask me, 
But I shall never tell! 
So From The Mould 
 
So from the mould 
Scarlet and Gold 
Many a Bulb will rise&mdash; 
Hidden away, cunningly, From sagacious eyes. 
So from Cocoon 
Many a Worm 
Leap so Highland gay, 
Peasants like me, 
Peasants like Thee 
Gaze perplexedly! 
So Glad We Are—a Stranger'D Deem 
 
So glad we are—a Stranger'd deem 
'Twas sorry, that we were— 
For where the Holiday should be 
There publishes a Tear— 
Nor how Ourselves be justified— 
Since Grief and Joy are done 
So similar—An Optizan 
Could not decide between— 
So Has A Daisy Vanished 
 
So has a Daisy vanished 
From the fields today&mdash; 
So tiptoed many a slipper 
To Paradise away&mdash; 
Oozed so in crimson bubbles 
Day's departing tide&mdash; 
Blooming&mdash;tripping&mdash;flowing 
Are ye then with God? 
So much of Heaven has gone from Earth 
So much of Heaven has gone from Earth 
That there must be a Heaven 
If only to enclose the Saints 
To Affidavit given. 
The Missionary to the Mole 
Must prove there is a Sky 
Location doubtless he would plead 
But what excuse have I? 
Too much of Proof affronts Belief 
The Turtle will not try 
Unless you leave him -then return 
And he has hauled away. 
So Much Summer 
 
So much Summer 
Me for showing 
Illegitimate&mdash; 
Would a Smile's minute bestowing 
Too exorbitant 
To the Lady 
With the Guinea 
Look&mdash;if She should know 
Crumb of Mine 
A Robin's Larder 
Would suffice to stow&mdash; 
So Proud She Was To Die 
So proud she was to die 
It made us all ashamed 
That what we cherished, so unknown 
To her desire seemed. 
So satisfied to go 
Where none of us should be, 
Immediately, that anguish stooped 
Almost to jealousy. 
So Set Its Sun In Thee 
 
So set its Sun in Thee 
What Day be dark to me&mdash; 
What Distance&mdash;far&mdash; 
So I the Ships may see 
That touch&mdash;how seldomly&mdash; 
Thy Shore? 
So The Eyes Accost—and Sunder 
 
So the Eyes accost—and sunder 
In an Audience— 
Stamped—occasionally—forever— 
So may Countenance 
Entertain—without addressing 
Countenance of One 
In a Neighboring Horizon— 
Gone—as soon as known— 
So Well That I Can Live Without 
 
So well that I can live without&mdash; 
I love thee&mdash;then How well is that? 
As well as Jesus? 
Prove it me 
That He&mdash;loved Men&mdash; 
As I&mdash;love thee&mdash; 
Soil Of Flint, If Steady Tilled 
 
Soil of Flint, if steady tilled&mdash; 
Will refund by Hand&mdash; 
Seed of Palm, by Libyan Sun 
Fructified in Sand&mdash; 
Some Days retired from the rest 
Some Days retired from the rest 
In soft distinction lie 
The Day that a Companion came 
Or was obliged to die 
Some Keep The Sabbath Going To Church 
Some keep the Sabbath going to Church -I 
keep it, staying at Home -With 
a Bobolink for a Chorister -And 
an Orchard, for a Dome -
Some keep the Sabbath in Surplice -I 
just wear my Wings -And 
instead of tolling the Bell, for Church, 
Our little Sexton -- sings. 
God preaches, a noted Clergyman -And 
the sermon is never long, 
So instead of getting to Heaven, at least -I'm 
going, all along. 
Some Rainbow—coming From The Fair! 
 
Some Rainbow—coming from the Fair! 
Some Vision of the World Cashmere— 
I confidently see! 
Or else a Peacock's purple Train 
Feather by feather—on the plain 
Fritters itself away! 
The dreamy Butterflies bestir! 
Lethargic pools resume the whir 
Of last year's sundered tune! 
From some old Fortress on the sun 
Baronial Bees—march—one by one— 
In murmuring platoon! 
The Robins stand as thick today 
As flakes of snow stood yesterday— 
On fence—and Roof—and Twig! 
The Orchis binds her feather on 
For her old lover - Don the Sun! 
Revisiting the Bog! 
Without Commander! Countless! Still! 
The Regiments of Wood and Hill 
In bright detachment stand! 
Behold! Whose Multitudes are these? 
The children of whose turbaned seas— 
Or what Circassian Land? 
Some Such Butterfly Be Seen 
 
Some such Butterfly be seen 
On Brazilian Pampas&mdash; 
Just at noon&mdash;no later&mdash;Sweet&mdash; 
Then&mdash;the License closes&mdash; 
Some such Spice&mdash;express and pass&mdash; 
Subject to Your Plucking&mdash; 
As the Stars&mdash;You knew last Night&mdash; 
Foreigners&mdash;This Morning&mdash; 
Some Things That Fly There Be 
 
Some things that fly there be&mdash; 
Birds&mdash;Hours&mdash;the Bumblebee&mdash; 
Of these no Elegy. 
Some things that stay there be&mdash; 
Grief&mdash;Hills&mdash;Eternity&mdash; 
Nor this behooveth me. 
There are that resting, rise. 
Can I expound the skies? 
How still the Riddle lies! 
Some, Too Fragile For Winter Winds 
 
Some, too fragile for winter winds 
The thoughtful grave encloses&mdash; 
Tenderly tucking them in from frost 
Before their feet are cold. 
Never the treasures in her nest 
The cautious grave exposes, 
Building where schoolboy dare not look, 
And sportsman is not bold. 
This covert have all the children 
Early aged, and often cold, 
Sparrow, unnoticed by the Father&mdash; 
Lambs for whom time had not a fold. 
Sometimes with the Heart 
Sometimes with the Heart 
Seldom with the Soul 
Scarcer once with the Might 
Few -love at all. 
Soto! Explore Thyself! 
 
Soto! Explore thyself! 
Therein thyself shalt find 
The "Undiscovered Continent"&mdash; 
No Settler had the Mind. 
Soul, Wilt Thou Toss Again? 
 
Soul, Wilt thou toss again? 
By just such a hazard 
Hundreds have lost indeed&mdash; 
But tens have won an all&mdash; 
Angel's breathless ballot 
Lingers to record thee&mdash; 
Imps in eager Caucus 
Raffle for my Soul! 
South Winds Jostle Them 
 
South Winds jostle them&mdash; 
Bumblebees come&mdash; 
Hover&mdash;hesitate&mdash; 
Drink, and are gone&mdash; 
Butterflies pause 
On their passage Cashmere&mdash; 
I&mdash;softly plucking, 
Present them here! 
Sown In Dishonor 
 
"Sown in dishonor"! 
Ah! Indeed! 
May this "dishonor" be? 
If I were half so fine myself 
I'd notice nobody! 
"Sown in corruption"! 
Not so fast! 
Apostle is askew! 
Corinthians 1. 15. narrates 
A Circumstance or two! 
Speech is one symptom of Affection 
Speech is one symptom of Affection 
And Silence one The 
perfectest communication 
Is heard of none 
Exists and its indorsement 
Is had within Behold,

'Speech'—is a prank of Parliament— 
'Tears'—is a trick of the nerve—

Split The Lark&Mdash;And You'Ll Find The Music 
 
Split the Lark&mdash;and you'll find the Music&mdash; 
Bulb after Bulb, in Silver rolled&mdash; 
Scantilly dealt to the Summer Morning 
Saved for your Ear when Lutes be old. 
Loose the Flood&mdash;you shall find it patent&mdash; 
Gush after Gush, reserved for you&mdash; 
Scarlet Experiment! Sceptic Thomas! 
Now, do you doubt that your Bird was true? 
Spring comes on the World 
Spring comes on the World I 
sight the Aprils -
Hueless to me until thou come 
As, till the Bee 
Blossoms stand negative, 
Touched to Conditions 
By a Hum. 
Spring Is The Period 
 
Spring is the Period 
Express from God. 
Among the other seasons 
Himself abide, 
But during March and April 
None stir abroad 
Without a cordial interview 
With God. 
STEP lightly on this narrow spot 
STEP lightly on this narrow spot!	 
The broadest land that grows	 
Is not so ample as the breast	 
These emerald seams enclose.	 
Step lofty; for this name is told	
As far as cannon dwell,	 
Or flag subsist, or fame export	 
Her deathless syllable.

Success Is Counted Sweetest 
Success is counted sweetest 
By those who ne'er succeed. 
To comprehend a nectar 
Requires sorest need. 
Not one of all the purple Host 
Who took the Flag today 
Can tell the definition 
So clear of Victory 
As he defeated--dying-On

The distant strains of triumph 
Burst agonized and clear!

Summer For Thee, Grant I May Be 
 
Summer for thee, grant I may be 
When Summer days are flown! 
Thy music still, when Whipporwill 
And Oriole&mdash;are done! 
For thee to bloom, I'll skip the tomb 
And row my blossoms o'er! 
Pray gather me&mdash; 
Anemone&mdash; 
Thy flower&mdash;forevermore! 
Summer Shower 
A drop fell on the apple tree, 
Another on the roof; 
A half a dozen kissed the eaves, 
And made the gables laugh. 
A few went out to help the brook, 
That went to help the sea. 
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls, 
What necklaces could be! 
The dust replaced in hoisted roads, 
The birds jocoser sung; 
The sunshine threw his hat away, 
The orchards spangles hung. 
The breezes brought dejected lutes, 
And bathed them in the glee; 
The East put out a single flag, 
And signed the fete away. 
Sunset At Night—is Natural 
 
Sunset at Night—is natural— 
But Sunset on the Dawn 
Reverses Nature—Master— 
So Midnight's—due—at Noon. 
Eclipses be—predicted— 
And Science bows them in— 
But do one face us suddenly— 
Jehovah's Watch—is wrong. 
Superfluous Were The Sun 
 
Superfluous were the Sun 
When Excellence be dead 
He were superfluous every Day 
For every Day be said 
That syllable whose Faith 
Just saves it from Despair 
And whose "I'll meet You" hesitates 
If Love inquire "Where"? 
Upon His dateless Fame 
Our Periods may lie 
As Stars that drop anonymous 
From an abundant sky.

Suspense—is Hostiler than Death— 
Death—tho'soever Broad, 
Is Just Death, and cannot increase—

But just anew to die— 
Annihilation—plated fresh 
With Immortality— 
Sweet Mountains—ye Tell Me No Lie 
 
Sweet Mountains—Ye tell Me no lie— 
Never deny Me—Never fly—

My Strong Madonnas—Cherish still— 
The Wayward Nun—beneath the Hill— 
Whose service—is to You— 
Her latest Worship—When the Day 
Fades from the Firmament away— 
To lift Her Brows on You—

T Was Just This Time Last Year I Died. 
'T was just this time last year I died. 
I know I heard the corn, 
When I was carried by the farms,-It 
had the tassels on. 
I thought how yellow it would look 
When Richard went to mill; 
And then I wanted to get out, 
But something held my will. 
I thought just how red apples wedged 
The stubble's joints between; 
And carts went stooping round the fields 
To take the pumpkins in. 
I wondered which would miss me least, 
And when Thanksgiving came, 
If father'd multiply the plates 
To make an even sum. 
And if my stocking hung too high, 
Would it blur the Christmas glee, 
That not a Santa Claus could reach 
The altitude of me? 
But this sort grieved myself, and so 
I thought how it would be 
When just this time, some perfect year, 
Themselves should come to me.

Of "Potose," and the mines! 
Reverently, to the Hungry

Anecdotes of air in Dungeons

As my thought—today— 
As should sound— 
"Forbid us not"— 
Some like "Emily." 
Tell All The Truth 
Tell all the truth but tell it slant, 
Success in circuit lies, 
Too bright for our infirm delight 
The truth's superb surprise; 
As lightning to the children eased 
With explanation kind, 
The truth must dazzle gradually 
Or every man be blind.

The very profile of the Thought 
Puts Recollection numb—

The Bat Is Dun With Wrinkled Wings	 
THE BAT is dun with wrinkled wings	 
Like fallow article,	 
And not a song pervades his lips,	 
Or none perceptible.	 
His small umbrella, quaintly halved, 
Describing in the air	 
An arc alike inscrutable,—	 
Elate philosopher!	 
Deputed from what firmament	 
Of what astute abode, 
Empowered with what malevolence	 
Auspiciously withheld.	 
To his adroit Creator	 
Ascribe no less the praise;	 
Beneficent, believe me, 
His eccentricities. 
The Battle Fought Between The Soul 
 
The Battle fought between the Soul

The Battlefield 
They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars, 
Like petals from a rose, 
When suddenly across the June 
A wind with fingers goes. 
They perished in the seamless grass, — 
No eye could find the place; 
But God on his repealless list 
Can summon every face.

Wherefore, Oh Summer's Day?

Our Contract 
A Wiser Sympathy 
The Black Berry—wears A Thorn In His Side 
The Black Berry—wears a Thorn in his side— 
But no Man heard Him cry— 
He offers His Berry, just the same 
To Partridge—and to Boy— 
He sometimes holds upon the Fence— 
Or struggles to a Tree— 
Or clasps a Rock, with both His Hands— 
But not for Sympathy— 
We—tell a Hurt—to cool it— 
This Mourner—to the Sky 
A little further reaches—instead— 
Brave Black Berry— 
The Blue Jay 
No brigadier throughout the year 
So civic as the jay. 
A neighbor and a warrior too, 
With shrill felicity 
Pursuing winds that censure us 
A February day, 
The brother of the universe 
Was never blown away. 
The snow and he are intimate; 
I 've often seen them play 
When heaven looked upon us all 
With such severity, 
I felt apology were due 
To an insulted sky, 
Whose pompous frown was nutriment 
To their temerity. 
The pillow of this daring head 
Is pungent evergreens; 
His larder — terse and militant — 
Unknown, refreshing things; 
His character a tonic, 
His future a dispute; 
Unfair an immortality 
That leaves this neighbor out.

The Bustle In A House 
The bustle in a house 
The morning after death

The sweeping up the heart,

Until eternity.

Assuredly will lie 
But none will pass the Catacomb 
So chastened as the Fly

The butterfly obtains 
But little sympathy 
Though favorably mentioned

Because he travels freely

The Butterfly Upon The Sky 
The Butterfly upon the Sky, 
That doesn't know its Name

And that's the way to grieve 
The Butterfly's Assumption Gown 
The Butterfly's Assumption Gown 
In Chrysoprase Apartments hung 
This afternoon put on 
How condescending to descend 
And be of Buttercups the friend 
In a New England Town 
The Chariot 
Because I could not stop for Death, 
He kindly stopped for me; 
The carriage held but just ourselves 
And Immortality. 
We slowly drove, he knew no haste, 
And I had put away 
My labor, and my leisure too, 
For his civility. 
We passed the school where children played, 
Their lessons scarcely done; 
We passed the fields of gazing grain, 
We passed the setting sun. 
We paused before a house that seemed 
A swelling of the ground; 
The roof was scarcely visible. 
The cornice but a mound. 
Since then 'tis centuries; but each 
Feels shorter than the day 
I first surmised the horses' heads 
Were toward eternity.

Beryl&mdash;and this, at Noon&mdash; 
And when at night&mdash;Auroran widths 
Fling suddenly on men&mdash; 
'Tis this&mdash;and Witchcraft&mdash;nature keeps 
A Rank&mdash;for Iodine&mdash; 
The Color Of The Grave Is Green 
 
The Color of the Grave is Green&mdash; 
The Outer Grave&mdash;I mean&mdash; 
You would not know it from the Field&mdash; 
Except it own a Stone&mdash; 
To help the fond&mdash;to find it&mdash; 
Too infinite asleep 
To stop and tell them where it is&mdash; 
But just a Daisy&mdash;deep&mdash; 
The Color of the Grave is white&mdash; 
The outer Grave&mdash;I mean&mdash; 
You would not know it from the Drifts&mdash; 
In Winter&mdash;till the Sun&mdash; 
Has furrowed out the Aisles&mdash; 
Then&mdash;higher than the Land 
The little Dwelling Houses rise 
Where each&mdash;has left a friend&mdash; 
The Color of the Grave within&mdash; 
The Duplicate&mdash;I mean&mdash; 
Not all the Snows could make it white&mdash; 
Not all the Summers&mdash;Green&mdash; 
You've seen the Color&mdash;maybe&mdash; 
Upon a Bonnet bound&mdash; 
When that you met it with before&mdash; 
The Ferret&mdash;cannot find&mdash; 
The Court Is Far Away 
 
The Court is far away&mdash; 
No Umpire&mdash;have I&mdash; 
My Sovereign is offended&mdash; 
To gain his grace&mdash;I'd die! 
I'll seek his royal feet&mdash; 
I'll say&mdash;Remember&mdash;King&mdash; 
Thou shalt&mdash;thyself&mdash;one day&mdash;a Child&mdash; 
Implore a larger&mdash;thing&mdash; 
That Empire&mdash;is of Czars&mdash; 
As small&mdash;they say&mdash;as I&mdash; 
Grant me&mdash;that day&mdash;the royalty&mdash; 
To intercede&mdash;for Thee&mdash; 
The Cricket Sang, 
The cricket sang, 
And set the sun, 
And workmen finished, one by one,
 Their seam the day upon. 
The low grass loaded with the dew, 
The twilight stood as strangers do 
With hat in hand, polite and new,
 To stay as if, or go. 
A vastness, as a neighbor, came,-A 
wisdom without face or name, 
A peace, as hemispheres at home,-
And so the night became. 
The Daisy Follows Soft The Sun 
 
The Daisy follows soft the Sun&mdash; 
And when his golden walk is done&mdash; 
Sits shyly at his feet&mdash; 
He&mdash;waking&mdash;finds the flower there&mdash; 
Wherefore&mdash;Marauder&mdash;art thou here? 
Because, Sir, love is sweet! 
We are the Flower&mdash;Thou the Sun! 
Forgive us, if as days decline&mdash; 
We nearer steal to Thee! 
Enamored of the parting West&mdash; 
The peace&mdash;the flight&mdash;the Amethyst&mdash; 
Night's possibility! 
The Day Came Slow 
The day came slow, till five o'clock, 
Then sprang before the hills, 
Like hindered rubies, or the light, 
A sudden musket spills. 
The purple could not keep the east. 
The sunrise shook from fold. 
Like breadths of topaz, packed a night, 
The lady just unrolled. 
The happy winds their timbrels took; 
The birds in docile rows, 
Arranged themselves around their prince. 
(The wind is prince of those.) 
The orchard sparkled like a Jew,--How 
mighty 'twas to stay, 
A guest in this stupendous place, 
The parlor of the day. 
The Day That I Was Crowned 
 
The Day that I was crowned 
Was like the other Days&mdash; 
Until the Coronation came&mdash; 
And then&mdash;'twas Otherwise&mdash; 
As Carbon in the Coal 
And Carbon in the Gem 
Are One&mdash;and yet the former 
Were dull for Diadem&mdash; 
I rose, and all was plain&mdash; 
But when the Day declined 
Myself and It, in Majesty 
Were equally&mdash;adorned&mdash; 
The Grace that I&mdash;was chose&mdash; 
To Me&mdash;surpassed the Crown 
That was the Witness for the Grace&mdash; 
'Twas even that 'twas Mine&mdash; 
The Day Undressed&Mdash;Herself 
 
The Day undressed&mdash;Herself&mdash; 
Her Garter&mdash;was of Gold&mdash; 
Her Petticoat&mdash;of Purple plain&mdash; 
Her Dimities&mdash;as old 
Exactly&mdash;as the World&mdash; 
And yet the newest Star&mdash; 
Enrolled upon the Hemisphere 
Be wrinkled&mdash;much as Her&mdash; 
Too near to God&mdash;to pray&mdash; 
Too near to Heaven&mdash;to fear&mdash; 
The Lady of the Occident 
Retired without a care&mdash; 
Her Candle so expire 
The flickering be seen 
On Ball of Mast in Bosporus&mdash; 
And Dome&mdash;and Window Pane&mdash; 
The Definition Of Beauty Is 
 
The Definition of Beauty is 
That Definition is none&mdash; 
Of Heaven, easing Analysis, 
Since Heaven and He are one. 
The Devil -had he fidelity 
The Devil -had he fidelity 
Would be the best friend Because 
he has ability But 
Devils cannot mend Perfidy 
is the virtue 
That would but he resign 
The Devil -without question 
Were thoroughly divine 
The Difference Between Despair 
 
The difference between Despair 
And Fear&mdash;is like the One 
Between the instant of a Wreck 
And when the Wreck has been&mdash; 
The Mind is smooth&mdash;no Motion&mdash; 
Contented as the Eye 
Upon the Forehead of a Bust&mdash; 
That knows&mdash;it cannot see&mdash; 
The Doomed—regard The Sunrise 
 
The Doomed—regard the Sunrise 
With different Delight— 
Because—when next it burns abroad 
They doubt to witness it— 
The Man—to die—tomorrow— 
Harks for the Meadow Bird— 
Because its Music stirs the Axe 
That clamors for his head— 
Joyful—to whom the Sunrise 
Precedes Enamored—Day— 
Joyful—for whom the Meadow Bird 
Has ought but Elegy! 
The Drop, That Wrestles In The Sea 
 
The Drop, that wrestles in the Sea&mdash; 
Forgets her own locality&mdash; 
As I&mdash;toward Thee&mdash; 
She knows herself an incense small&mdash; 
Yet small&mdash;she sighs&mdash;if All&mdash;is All&mdash; 
How larger&mdash;be? 
The Ocean&mdash;smiles&mdash;at her Conceit&mdash; 
But she, forgetting Amphitrite&mdash; 
Pleads&mdash;"Me"? 
The Dust Behind I Strove To Join 
 
The Dust behind I strove to join 
Unto the Disk before&mdash; 
But Sequence ravelled out of Sound 
Like Balls upon a Floor&mdash; 
The Duties Of The Wind Are Few 
The duties of the Wind are few, 
To cast the ships, at Sea, 
Establish March, the Floods escort, 
And usher Liberty. 
The pleasures of the Wind are broad, 
To dwell Extent among, 
Remain, or wander, 
Speculate, or Forests entertain. 
The kinsmen of the Wind are Peaks 
Azof -the Equinox, 
Also with Bird and Asteroid 
A bowing intercourse. 
The limitations of the Wind 
Do he exist, or die, 
Too wise he seems for Wakelessness, 
However, know not i. 
The Dying Need But Little, Dear,-
The dying need but little, dear,-A 
glass of water's all, 
A flower's unobtrusive face 
To punctuate the wall, 
A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret, 
And certainly that one 
No color in the rainbow 
Perceives when you are gone. 
The Earth Has Many Keys 
The earth has many keys, 
Where melody is not 
Is the unknown peninsula. 
Beauty is nature's fact. 
But witness for her land, 
And witness for her sea, 
The cricket is her utmost 
Of elegy to me. 
The Face I Carry With Me—last 
 
The face I carry with me—last— 
When I go out of Time— 
To take my Rank—by—in the West— 
That face—will just be thine— 
I'll hand it to the Angel— 
That—Sir—was my Degree— 
In Kingdoms—you have heard the Raised— 
Refer to—possibly. 
He'll take it—scan it—step aside— 
Return—with such a crown 
As Gabriel—never capered at— 
And beg me put it on— 
And then—he'll turn me round and round— 
To an admiring sky— 
As one that bore her Master's name— 
Sufficient Royalty! 
The Face we choose to miss 
The Face we choose to miss Be 
it but for a Day 
As absent as a Hundred Years, 
When it has rode away. 
The Feet Of People Walking Home 
 
The feet of people walking home 
With gayer sandals go&mdash; 
The Crocus&mdash; til she rises 
The Vassal of the snow&mdash; 
The lips at Hallelujah 
Long years of practise bore 
Til bye and bye these Bargemen 
Walked singing on the shore. 
Pearls are the Diver's farthings 
Extorted from the Sea&mdash; 
Pinions&mdash; the Seraph's wagon 
Pedestrian once&mdash; as we&mdash; 
Night is the morning's Canvas 
Larceny&mdash; legacy&mdash; 
Death, but our rapt attention 
To Immortality. 
My figures fail to tell me 
How far the Village lies&mdash; 
Whose peasants are the Angels&mdash; 
Whose Cantons dot the skies&mdash; 
My Classics veil their faces&mdash; 
My faith that Dark adores&mdash; 
Which from its solemn abbeys 
Such ressurection pours. 
The Fingers Of The Light 
 
The Fingers of the Light 
Tapped soft upon the Town 
With "I am great and cannot wait 
So therefore let me in." 
"You're soon," the Town replied, 
"My Faces are asleep&mdash; 
But swear, and I will let you by, 
You will not wake them up." 
The easy Guest complied 
But once within the Town 
The transport of His Countenance 
Awakened Maid and Man 
The Neighbor in the Pool 
Upon His Hip elate 
Made loud obeisance and the Gnat 
Held up His Cup for Light. 
The First Day That I Was A Life 
 
The first Day that I was a Life 
I recollect it&mdash;How still&mdash; 
That last Day that I was a Life 
I recollect it&mdash;as well&mdash; 
'Twas stiller&mdash;though the first 
Was still&mdash; 
"Twas empty&mdash;but the first 
Was full&mdash; 
This&mdash;was my finallest Occasion&mdash; 
But then 
My tenderer Experiment 
Toward Men&mdash; 
"Which choose I"? 
That&mdash;I cannot say&mdash; 
"Which choose They"? 
Question Memory! 
The First Day's Night Had Come 
 
The first Day's Night had come&mdash; 
And grateful that a thing 
So terrible&mdash;had been endured&mdash; 
I told my Soul to sing&mdash; 
She said her Strings were snapt&mdash; 
Her Bow&mdash;to Atoms blown&mdash; 
And so to mend her&mdash;gave me work 
Until another Morn&mdash; 
And then&mdash;a Day as huge 
As Yesterdays in pairs, 
Unrolled its horror in my face&mdash; 
Until it blocked my eyes&mdash; 
My Brain&mdash;begun to laugh&mdash; 
I mumbled&mdash;like a fool&mdash; 
And tho' 'tis Years ago&mdash;that Day&mdash; 
My Brain keeps giggling&mdash;still. 
And Something's odd&mdash;within&mdash; 
That person that I was&mdash; 
And this One&mdash;do not feel the same&mdash; 
Could it be Madness&mdash;this? 
The Flower Must Not Blame The Bee 
 
The Flower must not blame the Bee&mdash; 
That seeketh his felicity 
Too often at her door&mdash; 
But teach the Footman from Vevay&mdash; 
Mistress is "not at home"&mdash;to say&mdash; 
To people&mdash;any more! 
The Future—never Spoke 
 
The Future—never spoke— 
Nor will He—like the Dumb— 
Reveal by sign—a syllable 
Of His Profound To Come— 
But when the News be ripe— 
Presents it—in the Act— 
Forestalling Preparation— 
Escape—or Substitute— 
Indifference to Him— 
The Dower—as the Doom— 
His Office—but to execute 
Fate's—Telegram—to Him— 
The Gentian Weaves Her Fringes 
 
The Gentian weaves her fringes&mdash; 
The Maple's loom is red&mdash; 
My departing blossoms
 Obviate parade. 
A brief, but patient illness&mdash; 
An hour to prepare, 
And one below this morning 
Is where the angels are&mdash; 
It was a short procession, 
The Bobolink was there&mdash; 
An aged Bee addressed us&mdash; 
And then we knelt in prayer&mdash; 
We trust that she was willing&mdash; 
We ask that we may be. 
Summer&mdash;Sister&mdash;Seraph! 
Let us go with thee! 
In the name of the Bee&mdash; 
And of the Butterfly&mdash; 
And of the Breeze&mdash;Amen! 
The Going From A World We Know 
The going from a world we know 
To one a wonder still 
Is like the child's adversity 
Whose vista is a hill, 
Behind the hill is sorcery 
And everything unknown, 
But will the secret compensate 
For climbing it alone? 
The Good Will Of A Flower 
 
The good Will of a Flower 
The Man who would possess 
Must first present 
Certificate 
Of minted Holiness. 
The Grace—myself—might Not Obtain 
 
The Grace—Myself—might not obtain— 
Confer upon My flower— 
Refracted but a Countenance— 
For I—inhabit Her— 
The Grass So Little Has To Do 
The Grass so little has to do – 
A Sphere of simple Green – 
With only Butterflies to brood 
And Bees to entertain – 
And stir all day to pretty Tunes 
The Breezes fetch along – 
And hold the Sunshine in its lap 
And bow to everything – 
And thread the Dews, all night, like Pearls – 
And make itself so fine 
A Duchess were too common 
For such a noticing – 
And even when it dies – to pass 
In Odors so divine – 
Like Lowly spices, lain to sleep – 
Or Spikenards, perishing – 
And then, in Sovereign Barns to dwell – 
And dream the Days away, 
The Grass so little has to do 
I wish I were a Hay – 
The grave my little cottage is 
The grave my little cottage is, 
Where 'Keeping house' for thee 
I make my parlor orderly 
And lay the marble tea. 
For two divided, briefly, 
A cycle, it may be, 
Till everlasting life unite 
In strong society. 
The Guest Is Gold And Crimson 
 
The Guest is gold and crimson&mdash; 
An Opal guest and gray&mdash; 
Of Ermine is his doublet&mdash; 
His Capuchin gay&mdash; 
He reaches town at nightfall&mdash; 
He stops at every door&mdash; 
Who looks for him at morning 
I pray him too&mdash;explore 
The Lark's pure territory&mdash; 
Or the Lapwing's shore! 
The Hallowing Of Pain 
 
The hallowing of Pain 
Like hallowing of Heaven, 
Obtains at a corporeal cost&mdash; 
The Summit is not given 
To Him who strives severe 
At middle of the Hill&mdash; 
But He who has achieved the Top&mdash; 
All&mdash;is the price of All&mdash; 
The Heart Asks Pleasure First 
The heart asks pleasure first 
And then, excuse from pain-
And then, those little anodynes 
That deaden suffering; 
And then, to go to sleep; 
And then, if it should be 
The will of its Inquisitor, 
The liberty to die. 
The Heart Has Narrow Banks 
 
The Heart has narrow Banks 
It measures like the Sea 
In mighty&mdash;unremitting Bass 
And Blue Monotony 
Till Hurricane bisect 
And as itself discerns 
Its sufficient Area 
The Heart convulsive learns 
That Calm is but a Wall 
Of unattempted Gauze 
An instant's Push demolishes 
A Questioning&mdash;dissolves. 
The Heaven Vests For Each 
 
The Heaven vests for Each 
In that small Deity 
It craved the grace to worship 
Some bashful Summer's Day&mdash; 
Half shrinking from the Glory 
It importuned to see 
Till these faint Tabernacles drop 
In full Eternity&mdash; 
How imminent the Venture&mdash; 
As one should sue a Star&mdash; 
For His mean sake to leave the Row 
And entertain Despair&mdash; 
A Clemency so common&mdash; 
We almost cease to fear&mdash; 
Enabling the minutest&mdash; 
And furthest&mdash;to adore&mdash; 
The Hills erect their Purple Heads 
The Hills erect their Purple Heads 
The Rivers lean to see 
Yet Man has not of all the Throng 
A Curiosity. 
The Hills in Purple syllables 
The Hills in Purple syllables 
The Day's Adventures tell 
To little Groups of Continents 
Just going Home from School. 
The Himmaleh Was Known To Stoop 
 
The Himmaleh was known to stoop 
Unto the Daisy low&mdash; 
Transported with Compassion 
That such a Doll should grow 
Where Tent by Tent&mdash;Her Universe 
Hung out its Flags of Snow&mdash; 
The Hollows Round His Eager Eyes 
 
The Hollows round His eager Eyes 
Were Pages where to read 
Pathetic Histories&mdash;although 
Himself had not complained. 
Biography to All who passed 
Of Unobtrusive Pain 
Except for the italic Face 
Endured, unhelped&mdash;unknown. 
The inundation of the Spring 
The inundation of the Spring 
Enlarges every soul It 
sweeps the tenement away 
But leaves the Water whole 
In which the soul at first estranged Seeks 
faintly for its shore 
But acclimated -pines no more 
For that Peninsula 
The Judge Is Like The Owl 
 
The Judge is like the Owl&mdash; 
I've heard my Father tell&mdash; 
And Owls do build in Oaks&mdash; 
So here's an Amber Sill&mdash; 
That slanted in my Path&mdash; 
When going to the Barn&mdash; 
And if it serve You for a House&mdash; 
Itself is not in vain&mdash; 
About the price&mdash;'tis small&mdash; 
I only ask a Tune 
At Midnight&mdash;Let the Owl select 
His favorite Refrain. 
The Juggler's Hat Her Country Is 
 
The Juggler's Hat her Country is&mdash; 
The Mountain Gorse&mdash;the Bee's! 
The Lady Feeds Her Little Bird 
 
The Lady feeds Her little Bird 
At rarer intervals&mdash; 
The little Bird would not dissent 
But meekly recognize 
The Gulf between the Hand and Her 
And crumbless and afar 
And fainting, on Her yellow Knee 
Fall softly, and adore&mdash; 
The Lamp Burns Sure—within 
 
The Lamp burns sure—within— 
Tho' Serfs—supply the Oil— 
It matters not the busy Wick— 
At her phosphoric toil! 
The Slave—forgets—to fill— 
The Lamp—burns golden—on— 
Unconscious that the oil is out— 
As that the Slave—is gone. 
The Last Night That She Lived 
 
The last Night that She lived 
It was a Common Night 
Except the Dying&mdash;this to Us 
Made Nature different 
We noticed smallest things&mdash; 
Things overlooked before 
By this great light upon our Minds 
Italicized&mdash;as 'twere. 
As We went out and in 
Between Her final Room 
And Rooms where Those to be alive 
Tomorrow were, a Blame 
That Others could exist 
While She must finish quite 
A Jealousy for Her arose 
So nearly infinite&mdash; 
We waited while She passed&mdash; 
It was a narrow time&mdash; 
Too jostled were Our Souls to speak 
At length the notice came. 
She mentioned, and forgot&mdash; 
Then lightly as a Reed 
Bent to the Water, struggled scarce&mdash; 
Consented, and was dead&mdash; 
And We&mdash;We placed the Hair&mdash; 
And drew the Head erect&mdash; 
And then an awful leisure was 
Belief to regulate&mdash; 
The Leaves Like Women Interchange 
 
The Leaves like Women interchange 
Exclusive Confidence&mdash; 
Somewhat of nods and somewhat 
Portentous inference. 
The Parties in both cases 
Enjoining secrecy&mdash; 
Inviolable compact 
To notoriety. 
The Loneliness One Dare Not Sound 
 
The Loneliness One dare not sound&mdash; 
And would as soon surmise 
As in its Grave go plumbing 
To ascertain the size&mdash; 
The Loneliness whose worst alarm 
Is lest itself should see&mdash; 
And perish from before itself 
For just a scrutiny&mdash; 
The Horror not to be surveyed&mdash; 
But skirted in the Dark&mdash; 
With Consciousness suspended&mdash; 
And Being under Lock&mdash; 
I fear me this&mdash;is Loneliness&mdash; 
The Maker of the soul 
Its Caverns and its Corridors 
Illuminate&mdash;or seal&mdash; 
The Lonesome For They Know Not What 
 
The lonesome for they know not What&mdash; 
The Eastern Exiles&mdash;be&mdash; 
Who strayed beyond the Amber line 
Some madder Holiday&mdash; 
And ever since&mdash;the purple Moat 
They strive to climb&mdash;in vain&mdash; 
As Birds&mdash;that tumble from the clouds 
Do fumble at the strain&mdash; 
The Blessed Ether&mdash;taught them&mdash; 
Some Transatlantic Morn&mdash; 
When Heaven&mdash;was too common&mdash;to miss&mdash; 
Too sure&mdash;to dote upon! 
The Love A Life Can Show Below 
 
The Love a Life can show Below 
Is but a filament, I know, 
Of that diviner thing 
That faints upon the face of Noon&mdash; 
And smites the Tinder in the Sun&mdash; 
And hinders Gabriel's Wing&mdash; 
'Tis this&mdash;in Music&mdash;hints and sways&mdash; 
And far abroad on Summer days&mdash; 
Distils uncertain pain&mdash; 
'Tis this enamors in the East&mdash; 
And tints the Transit in the West 
With harrowing Iodine&mdash; 
'Tis this&mdash;invites&mdash;appalls&mdash;endows&mdash; 
Flits&mdash;glimmers&mdash;proves&mdash;dissolves&mdash; 
Returns&mdash;suggests&mdash;convicts&mdash;enchants&mdash;

The Luxury To Apprehend 
 
The Luxury to apprehend 
The Luxury 'twould be 
To look at Thee a single time 
An Epicure of Me 
In whatsoever Presence makes 
Till for a further Food 
I scarcely recollect to starve 
So first am I supplied&mdash; 
The Luxury to meditate 
The Luxury it was 
To banguet on thy Countenance 
A Sumptuousness bestows 
On plainer Days, whose Table far 
As Certainty can see 
Is laden with a single Crumb 
The Consciousness of Thee. 
The Malay—took The Pearl 
 
The Malay—took the Pearl— 
Not—I—the Earl— 
I—feared the Sea—too much 
Unsanctified—to touch— 
Praying that I might be 
Worthy—the Destiny— 
The Swarthy fellow swam— 
And bore my Jewel—Home— 
Home to the Hut! What lot 
Had I—the Jewel—got— 
Borne on a Dusky Breasty— 
I had not deemed a Vest 
Of Amber—fit— 
The Negro never knew 
I—wooed it—too— 
To gain, or be undone—

The Manner of its Death 
When Certain it must die&mdash;

'Twas Major Andre's Way&mdash; 
When Choice of Life&mdash;is past&mdash; 
There yet remains a Love 
Its little Fate to stipulate&mdash; 
How small in those who live&mdash; 
The Miracle to tease 
With Bable of the styles&mdash; 
How "they are Dying mostly&mdash;now"&mdash; 
And Customs at "St. James"! 
The Martyr Poets—did Not Tell 
 
The Martyr Poets—did not tell— 
But wrought their Pang in syllable— 
That when their mortal name be numb— 
Their mortal fate—encourage Some— 
The Martyr Painters—never spoke— 
Bequeathing—rather—to their Work— 
That when their conscious fingers cease— 
Some seek in Art—the Art of Peace— 
The Missing All—prevented Me 
 
The Missing All—prevented Me 
From missing minor Things. 
If nothing larger than a World's 
Departure from a Hinge— 
Or Sun's extinction, be observed— 
'Twas not so large that I 
Could lift my Forehead from my work 
For Curiosity. 
The Months Have Ends—the Years—a Knot 
 
The Months have ends—the Years—a knot— 
No Power can untie 
To stretch a little further 
A Skein of Misery— 
The Earth lays back these tired lives 
In her mysterious Drawers— 
Too tenderly, that any doubt 
An ultimate Repose— 
The manner of the Children— 
Who weary of the Day— 
Themself—the noisy Plaything 
They cannot put away— 
The Moon Was But A Chin Of Gold 
 
The Moon was but a Chin of Gold 
A Night or two ago&mdash; 
And now she turns Her perfect Face 
Upon the World below&mdash; 
Her Forehead is of Amplest Blonde&mdash; 
Her Cheek&mdash;a Beryl hewn&mdash; 
Her Eye unto the Summer Dew 
The likest I have known&mdash; 
Her Lips of Amber never part&mdash; 
But what must be the smile 
Upon Her Friend she could confer 
Were such Her Silver Will&mdash; 
And what a privilege to be 
But the remotest Star&mdash; 
For Certainty She take Her Way 
Beside Your Palace Door&mdash; 
Her Bonnet is the Firmament&mdash; 
The Universe&mdash;Her Shoe&mdash; 
The Stars&mdash;the Trinkets at Her Belt&mdash;

The Morning After Woe 
 
The Morning after Woe&mdash; 
'Tis frequently the Way&mdash; 
Surpasses all that rose before&mdash; 
For utter Jubilee&mdash; 
As Nature did not care&mdash; 
And piled her Blossoms on&mdash; 
And further to parade a Joy 
Her Victim stared upon&mdash; 
The Birds declaim their Tunes&mdash; 
Pronouncing every word 
Like Hammers&mdash;Did they know they fell 
Like Litanies of Lead&mdash; 
On here and there&mdash;a creature&mdash; 
They'd modify the Glee 
To fit some Crucifixal Clef&mdash; 
Some Key of Calvary&mdash; 
The Morns Are Meeker Than They Were 
 
The morns are meeker than they were&mdash; 
The nuts are getting brown&mdash; 
The berry's cheek is plumper&mdash; 
The Rose is out of town. 
The Maple wears a gayer scarf&mdash; 
The field a scarlet gown&mdash; 
Lest I should be old fashioned 
I'll put a trinket on. 
The Mountain Sat Upon The Plain 
 
The Mountain sat upon the Plain 
In his tremendous Chair&mdash; 
His observation omnifold, 
His inquest, everywhere&mdash; 
The Seasons played around his knees 
Like Children round a sire&mdash; 
Grandfather of the Days is He 
Of Dawn, the Ancestor&mdash; 
The Mountains—grow Unnoticed 
 
The Mountains—grow unnoticed— 
Their Purple figures rise

Assistance—or Applause—

The Sun—with just delight 
Looks long—and last—and golden— 
For fellowship—at night—

The Murmur of a Bee 
A Witchcraft&mdash;yieldeth me&mdash; 
If any ask me why&mdash;

The Red upon the Hill 
Taketh away my will&mdash; 
If anybody sneer&mdash; 
Take care&mdash;for God is here&mdash; 
That's all. 
The Breaking of the Day 
Addeth to my Degree&mdash; 
If any ask me how&mdash; 
Artist&mdash;who drew me so&mdash; 
Must tell! 
The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants 
The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants At 
Evening, it is not 
At Morning, in a Truffled Hut 
It stop opon a Spot 
As if it tarried always 
And yet it's whole Career 
Is shorter than a Snake's Delay And 
fleeter than a Tare 
'Tis Vegetation's Juggler The 
Germ of Alibi Doth 
like a Bubble antedate 
And like a Bubble, hie 
I feel as if the Grass was pleased 
To have it intermit This 
surreptitious Scion 
Of Summer's circumspect. 
Had Nature any supple Face 
Or could she one contemn Had 
Nature an Apostate That 
Mushroom - it is Him! 
The Mystery Of Pain 
Pain has an element of blank; 
It cannot recollect 
When it began, or if there were 
A day when it was not. 
It has no future but itself, 
Its infinite realms contain 
Its past, enlightened to perceive 
New periods of pain. 
The Name—of It—is 'Autumn' 
 
The name—of it—is 'Autumn'— 
The hue—of it—is Blood— 
An Artery—upon the Hill— 
A Vein—along the Road— 
Great Globules—in the Alleys— 
And Oh, the Shower of Stain— 
When Winds—upset the Basin— 
And spill the Scarlet Rain— 
It sprinkles Bonnets—far below— 
It gathers ruddy Pools— 
Then—eddies like a Rose—away— 
Upon Vermilion Wheels— 
The Nearest Dream Recedes, Unrealized. 
The nearest dream recedes, unrealized. 
The heaven we chase 
Like the June bee 
Before the school-boy 
Invites the race; 
Stoops to an easy clover 
Dips--evades--teases--deploys; 
Then to the royal clouds 
Lifts his light pinnace 
Heedless of the boy 
Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.
 Homesick for steadfast honey, 
Ah! the bee flies not 
That brews that rare variety. 
The Night Was Wide, And Furnished Scant 
 
The Night was wide, and furnished scant 
With but a single Star&mdash; 
That often as a Cloud it met&mdash; 
Blew out itself&mdash;for fear&mdash; 
The Wind pursued the little Bush&mdash; 
And drove away the Leaves 
November left&mdash;then clambered up 
And fretted in the Eaves&mdash; 
No Squirrel went abroad&mdash; 
A Dog's belated feet 
Like intermittent Plush, he heard 
Adown the empty Street&mdash; 
To feel if Blinds be fast&mdash; 
And closer to the fire&mdash; 
Her little Rocking Chair to draw&mdash; 
And shiver for the Poor&mdash; 
The Housewife's gentle Task&mdash; 
How pleasanter&mdash;said she 
Unto the Sofa opposite&mdash; 
The Sleet&mdash;than May, no Thee&mdash; 
The Notice that is called the Spring 
The Notice that is called the Spring 
Is but a month from here Put 
up my Heart thy Hoary work 
And take a Rosy Chair. 
Not any House the Flowers keep The 
Birds enamor Care Our 
salary the longest Day 
Is nothing but a Bier. 
The One Who Could Repeat The Summer Day 
 
The One who could repeat the Summer day&mdash; 
Were greater than itself&mdash;though He 
Minutest of Mankind should be&mdash; 
And He&mdash;could reproduce the Sun&mdash; 
At period of going down&mdash; 
The Lingering&mdash;and the Stain&mdash;I mean&mdash; 
When Orient have been outgrown 
And Occident&mdash;become Unknown&mdash; 
His Name&mdash;remain&mdash; 
The Only Ghost I Ever Saw 
The only ghost I ever saw 
Was dressed in mechlin, --so; 
He wore no sandal on his foot, 
And stepped like flakes of snow. 
His gait was soundless, like the bird, 
But rapid, like the roe; 
His fashions quaint, mosaic, 
Or, haply, mistletoe. 
Hi conversation seldom, 
His laughter like the breeze 
That dies away in dimples 
Among the pensive trees. 
Our interview was transient, -Of 
me, himself was shy; 
And God forbid I look behind 
Since that appalling day! 
The Only News I Know 
 
The Only News I know 
Is Bulletins all Day 
From Immortality. 
The Only Shows I see&mdash; 
Tomorrow and Today&mdash; 
Perchance Eternity&mdash; 
The Only One I meet 
Is God&mdash;The Only Street&mdash; 
Existence&mdash;This traversed 
If Other News there be&mdash; 
Or Admirable Show&mdash; 
I'll tell it You&mdash; 
The Outer—from The Inner 
 
The Outer—from the Inner 
Derives its Magnitude— 
'Tis Duke, or Dwarf, according 
As is the Central Mood— 
The fine—unvarying Axis 
That regulates the Wheel— 
Though Spokes—spin—more conspicuous 
And fling a dust—the while. 
The Inner—paints the Outer— 
The Brush without the Hand— 
Its Picture publishes—precise— 
As is the inner Brand— 
On fine—Arterial Canvas— 
A Cheek—perchance a Brow— 
The Star's whole Secret—in the Lake— 
Eyes were not meant to know. 
The Pedigree Of Honey 
The pedigree of honey 
Does not concern the bee; 
A clover, any time, to him 
Is aristocracy. 
The Poets Light But Lamps 
 
The Poets light but Lamps&mdash;

That Man&mdash;be qualified 
To qualify Despair 
To Those who failing new&mdash;

The Railway Train 
I like to see it lap the miles, 
And lick the valleys up, 
And stop to feed itself at tanks; 
And then, prodigious, step 
Around a pile of mountains, 
And, supercilious, peer 
In shanties by the sides of roads; 
And then a quarry pare 
To fit its sides, and crawl between, 
Complaining all the while 
In horrid, hooting stanza; 
Then chase itself down the hill 
And neigh like Boanerges; 
Then, punctual as a star, 
Stop - docile and omnipotent At 
its own stable door. 
The Rainbow Never Tells Me 
 
The rainbow never tells me 
That gust and storm are by, 
Yet is she more convincing 
Than Philosophy. 
My flowers turn from Forums&mdash; 
Yet eloquent declare 
What Cato couldn't prove me 
Except the birds were here!

The Red—Blaze—is the Morning— 
The Violet—is Noon—

But Miles of Sparks—at Evening—

The Territory Argent—that

The reticent volcano keeps 
The reticent volcano keeps 
His never slumbering plan Confided 
are his projects pink 
To no precarious man. 
If nature will not tell the tale 
Jehovah told to her 
Can human nature not survive 
Without a listener? 
Admonished by her buckled lips 
Let every babbler be 
The only secret people keep 
Is Immortality.

The Robin for the Crumb 
Returns no syllable 
But long records the Lady's name 
In Silver Chronicle. 
The Robin Is The One 
 
The Robin is the One 
That interrupt the Morn 
With hurried&mdash;few&mdash;express Reports 
When March is scarcely on&mdash; 
The Robin is the One 
That overflow the Noon 
With her cherubic quantity&mdash; 
An April but begun&mdash; 
The Robin is the One 
That speechless from her Nest 
Submit that Home&mdash;and Certainty 
And Sanctity, are best 
The Robin's My Criterion For Tune 
 
The Robin's my Criterion for Tune&mdash; 
Because I grow&mdash;where Robins do&mdash; 
But, were I Cuckoo born&mdash; 
I'd swear by him&mdash; 
The ode familiar&mdash;rules the Noon&mdash; 
The Buttercup's, my Whim for Bloom&mdash; 
Because, we're Orchard sprung&mdash; 
But, were I Britain born,

The Rose did caper on her cheek&mdash; 
Her Bodice rose and fell&mdash; 
Her pretty speech&mdash;like drunken men&mdash; 
Did stagger pitiful&mdash; 
Her fingers fumbled at her work&mdash; 
Her needle would not go&mdash; 
What ailed so smart a little Maid&mdash; 
It puzzled me to know&mdash; 
Till opposite&mdash;I spied a cheek 
That bore another Rose&mdash; 
Just opposite&mdash;Another speech 
That like the Drunkard goes&mdash; 
A Vest that like her Bodice, danced&mdash; 
To the immortal tune&mdash; 
Till those two troubled&mdash;little Clocks 
Ticked softly into one. 
The Savior Must Have Been A Docile Gentleman 
(1487) 
The Savior must have been 
A docile Gentleman— 
To come so far so cold a Day 
For little Fellowmen— 
The Road to Bethlehem 
Since He and I were Boys 
Was leveled, but for that ‘twould be 
A rugged Billion Miles— 
The Sea Said 'Come' To The Brook 
The Sea said 'Come' to the Brook The 
Brook said 'Let me grow' The

Sea said 'I am he 
You cherished' -'Learned Waters Wisdom

The Service Without Hope 
 
The Service without Hope&mdash; 
Is tenderest, I think&mdash; 
Because 'tis unsustained 
By stint&mdash;Rewarded Work&mdash; 
Has impetus of Gain&mdash; 
And impetus of Goal&mdash; 
There is no Diligence like that 
That knows not an Until&mdash; 
The Show Is Not The Show, 
The show is not the show, 
But they that go. 
Menagerie to me 
My neighbor be. 
Fair play-Both 
went to see. 
The Skies Can'T Keep Their Secret! 
 
The Skies can't keep their secret! 
They tell it to the Hills&mdash; 
The Hills just tell the Orchards&mdash; 
And they&mdash;the Daffodils! 
A Bird&mdash;by chance&mdash;that goes that way&mdash; 
Soft overhears the whole&mdash; 
If I should bribe the little Bird&mdash; 
Who knows but she would tell? 
I think I won't&mdash;however&mdash; 
It's finer&mdash;not to know&mdash; 
If Summer were an Axiom&mdash; 
What sorcery had Snow? 
So keep your secret&mdash;Father! 
I would not&mdash;if I could, 
Know what the Sapphire Fellows, do, 
In your new-fashioned world! 
The Sky Is Low, The Clouds Are Mean, 
The sky is low, the clouds are mean, 
A travelling flake of snow 
Across a barn or through a rut 
Debates if it will go. 
A narrow wind complains all day 
How some one treated him; 
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught 
Without her diadem. 
The Snow That Never Drifts 
The Snow that never drifts The 
transient, fragrant snow 
That comes a single time a Year 
Is softly driving now 
So thorough in the Tree 
At night beneath the star 
That it was February's Foot 
Experience would swear 
Like Winter as a Face 
We stern and former knew 
Repaired of all but Loneliness 
By Nature's Alibit 
Were every storm so spice 
The Value could not be We 
buy with contrast -Pang is good 
As near as memory 
The Soul Has Bandaged Moments 
 
The Soul has Bandaged moments&mdash; 
When too appalled to stir&mdash; 
She feels some ghastly Fright come up 
And stop to look at her&mdash; 
Salute her&mdash;with long fingers&mdash; 
Caress her freezing hair&mdash; 
Sip, Goblin, from the very lips 
The Lover&mdash;hovered&mdash;o'er&mdash; 
Unworthy, that a thought so mean 
Accost a Theme&mdash;so&mdash;fair&mdash; 
The soul has moments of Escape&mdash; 
When bursting all the doors&mdash; 
She dances like a Bomb, abroad, 
And swings upon the Hours, 
As do the Bee&mdash;delirious borne&mdash; 
Long Dungeoned from his Rose&mdash; 
Touch Liberty&mdash;then know no more, 
But Noon, and Paradise&mdash; 
The Soul's retaken moments&mdash; 
When, Felon led along, 
With shackles on the plumed feet, 
And staples, in the Song, 
The Horror welcomes her, again, 
These, are not brayed of Tongue&mdash; 
The Soul Selects Her Own Society 
The Soul selects her own Society -Then 
-- shuts the Door -To 
her divine Majority -Present 
no more -
Unmoved -- she notes the Chariots -- pausing -At 
her low Gate -Unmoved 
-- an Emperor be kneeling 
Upon her Mat -
I've known her -- from an ample nation -Choose 
One -Then 
-- close the Valves of her attention -Like 
Stone -
The Soul That Hath A Guest

The Soul Unto Itself (683) 
The Soul unto itself 
Is an imperial friend -Or

Enemy -- could send -
Secure against its own -No 
treason it can fear -Itself

The Soul should stand in Awe -
The Soul's Distinct Connection 
 
The Soul's distinct connection 
With immortality

And Click&mdash;and Suddenness. 
The Soul's Superior Instants 
 
The Soul's Superior instants

For lower Recognition 
Than Her Omnipotent&mdash; 
This Mortal Abolition

As Apparition&mdash;subject 
To Autocratic Air&mdash; 
Eternity's disclosure 
To favorites&mdash;a few&mdash; 
Of the Colossal substance 
Of Immortality

The Spry Arms Of The Wind 
The spry Arms of the Wind 
If I could crawl between 
I have an errand imminent 
To an adjoining Zone 
I should not care to stop 
My Process is not long 
The Wind could wait without the Gate 
Or stroll the Town among. 
To ascertain the House

And hold the Wick of mine to it 
To light, and then return 
The Sun And Moon Must Make Their Haste 
 
The Sun and Moon must make their haste&mdash; 
The Stars express around

The Sun is gay or stark 
According to our Deed.

It magnifies our Freight 
The Sun Kept Setting—setting—still 
 
The Sun kept setting—setting—still 
No Hue of Afternoon— 
Upon the Village I perceived 
From House to House 'twas Noon— 
The Dusk kept dropping—dropping—still 
No Dew upon the Grass— 
But only on my Forehead stopped— 
And wandered in my Face— 
My Feet kept drowsing—drowsing—still 
My fingers were awake— 
Yet why so little sound—Myself 
Unto my Seeming—make? 
How well I knew the Light before— 
I could see it now— 
'Tis Dying—I am doing—but 
I'm not afraid to know— 
The Sun Kept Stooping—stooping 
 
The Sun kept stooping—stooping—low! 
The Hills to meet him rose! 
On his side, what Transaction! 
On their side, what Repose! 
Deeper and deeper grew the stain 
Upon the window pane— 
Thicker and thicker stood the feet 
Until the Tyrian 
Was crowded dense with Armies— 
So gay, so Brigadier— 
That I felt martial stirrings 
Who once the Cockade wore— 
Charged from my chimney corner— 
But Nobody was there! 
The Sun—just Touched The Morning 
 
The Sun—just touched the Morning— 
The Morning—Happy thing— 
Supposed that He had come to dwell— 
And Life would all be Spring! 
She felt herself supremer— 
A Raised—Ethereal Thing! 
Henceforth—for Her—What Holiday! 
Meanwhile—Her wheeling King— 
Trailed—slow—along the Orchards— 
His haughty—spangled Hems— 
Leaving a new necessity! 
The want of Diadems! 
The Morning—fluttered—staggered— 
Felt feebly—for Her Crown— 
Her unanointed forehead— 
Henceforth—Her only One! 
The Sunrise Runs For Both 
 
The Sunrise runs for Both&mdash; 
The East&mdash;Her Purple Troth 
Keeps with the Hill&mdash; 
The Noon unwinds Her Blue 
Till One Breadth cover Two&mdash; 
Remotest&mdash;still&mdash; 
Nor does the Night forget 
A Lamp for Each&mdash;to set&mdash; 
Wicks wide away&mdash; 
The North&mdash;Her blazing Sign 
Erects in Iodine&mdash; 
Till Both&mdash;can see&mdash; 
The Midnight's Dusky Arms 
Clasp Hemispheres, and Homes 
And so 
Upon Her Bosom&mdash;One&mdash; 
And One upon Her Hem&mdash; 
Both lie&mdash; 
The Sunset Stopped On Cottages 
 
The Sunset stopped on Cottages 
Where Sunset hence must be 
For treason not of His, but Life's, 
Gone Westerly, Today&mdash; 
The Sunset stopped on Cottages 
Where Morning just begun&mdash; 
What difference, after all, Thou mak'st 
Thou supercilious Sun? 
The Sweetest Heresy Received

That Man and Woman know&mdash;

Through fainter Nerve— 
Accept its Most—

The Thought Beneath So Slight A Film 
The thought beneath so slight a film 
Is more distincly seen, -As 
laces just reveal the surge, 
Or mists the Apennine. 
The Tint I Cannot Take—is Best 
 
The Tint I cannot take—is best— 
The Color too remote 
That I could show it in Bazaar— 
A Guinea at a sight— 
The fine—impalpable Array— 
That swaggers on the eye 
Like Cleopatra's Company— 
Repeated—in the sky— 
The Moments of Dominion 
That happen on the Soul 
And leave it with a Discontent 
Too exquisite—to tell— 
The eager look—on Landscapes— 
As if they just repressed 
Some Secret—that was pushing 
Like Chariots—in the Vest— 
The Pleading of the Summer— 
That other Prank—of Snow— 
That Cushions Mystery with Tulle, 
For fear the Squirrels—know. 
Their Graspless manners—mock us— 
Until the Cheated Eye 
Shuts arrogantly—in the Grave— 
Another way—to see— 
The Trees Like Tassels—hit—and Swung 
 
The Trees like Tassels—hit—and swung— 
There seemed to rise a Tune 
From Miniature Creatures 
Accompanying the Sun— 
Far Psalteries of Summer— 
Enamoring the Ear 
They never yet did satisfy— 
Remotest—when most fair 
The Sun shone whole at intervals— 
Then Half—then utter hid— 
As if Himself were optional 
And had Estates of Cloud 
Sufficient to enfold Him 
Eternally from view— 
Except it were a whim of His 
To let the Orchards grow— 
A Bird sat careless on the fence— 
One gossipped in the Lane 
On silver matters charmed a Snake 
Just winding round a Stone— 
Bright Flowers slit a Calyx 
And soared upon a Stem 
Like Hindered Flags—Sweet hoisted— 
With Spices—in the Hem— 
'Twas more—I cannot mention— 
How mean—to those that see— 
Vandyke's Delineation 
Of Nature's—Summer Day! 
The Truth—is Stirless 
 
The Truth—is stirless— 
Other force—may be presumed to move— 
This—then—is best for confidence— 
When oldest Cedars swerve— 
And Oaks untwist their fists— 
And Mountains—feeble—lean— 
How excellent a Body, that 
Stands without a Bone— 
How vigorous a Force 
That holds without a Prop— 
Truth stays Herself—and every man 
That trusts Her—boldly up— 
The Veins Of Other Flowers 
 
The Veins of other Flowers 
The Scarlet Flowers are 
Till Nature leisure has for Terms 
As "Branch," and "Jugular." 
We pass, and she abides. 
We conjugate Her Skill 
While She creates and federates 
Without a syllable. 
The Way I Read A Letter's—this 
 
The Way I read a Letter's—this— 
'Tis first—I lock the Door— 
And push it with my fingers—next— 
For transport it be sure— 
And then I go the furthest off 
To counteract a knock— 
Then draw my little Letter forth 
And slowly pick the lock— 
Then—glancing narrow, at the Wall— 
And narrow at the floor 
For firm Conviction of a Mouse 
Not exorcised before— 
Peruse how infinite I am 
To no one that You—know— 
And sigh for lack of Heaven—but not 
The Heaven God bestow— 
The White Heat 
Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat? 
Then crouch within the door -Red 
-- is the Fire's common tint -But 
when the vivid Ore 
Has vanquished Flame's conditions, 
It quivers from the Forge 
Without a color, but the light 
Of unanointed Blaze. 
Least Village has its Blacksmith 
Whose Anvil's even ring 
Stands symbol for the finer Forge 
That soundless tugs -- within -Re[
f]ining these impatient Ores 
With Hammer, and with Blaze 
Untile the Designated Light 
Repudiate the Forge 
The Whole Of It Came Not At Once 
 
The Whole of it came not at once&mdash; 
'Twas Murder by degrees&mdash; 
A Thrust&mdash;and then for Life a chance&mdash; 
The Bliss to cauterize&mdash; 
The Cat reprieves the Mouse 
She eases from her teeth 
Just long enough for Hope to tease&mdash;

The Wind Begun To Knead The Grass 
 
[first version] 
The Wind begun to knead the Grass&mdash; 
As Women do a Dough&mdash; 
He flung a Hand full at the Plain&mdash; 
A Hand full at the Sky&mdash; 
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees&mdash; 
And started all abroad&mdash; 
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands&mdash; 
And throw away the Road&mdash; 
The Wagons&mdash;quickened on the Street&mdash; 
The Thunders gossiped low&mdash; 
The Lightning showed a Yellow Head&mdash; 
And then a livid Toe&mdash; 
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests&mdash; 
The Cattle flung to Barns&mdash; 
Then came one drop of Giant Rain&mdash; 
And then, as if the Hands 
That held the Dams&mdash;had parted hold&mdash; 
The Waters Wrecked the Sky&mdash; 
But overlooked my Father's House&mdash; 
Just Quartering a Tree&mdash; 
[second version] 
The Wind begun to rock the Grass 
With threatening Tunes and low&mdash; 
He threw a Menace at the Earth&mdash; 
A Menace at the Sky. 
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees&mdash; 
And started all abroad 
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands 
And threw away the Road. 
The Wagons quickened on the Streets 
The Thunder hurried slow&mdash; 
The Lightning showed a Yellow Beak 
And then a livid Claw. 
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests&mdash; 
The Cattle fled to Barns&mdash; 
There came one drop of Giant Rain 
And then as if the Hands 
That held the Dams had parted hold 
The Waters Wrecked the Sky, 
But overlooked my Father's House&mdash; 
Just quartering a Tree&mdash; 
The Wind Begun To Rock The Grass 
The wind begun to rock the grass 
With threatening tunes and low,-He 
flung a menace at the earth, 
A menace at the sky. 
The leaves unhooked themselves from trees 
And started all abroad; 
The dust did scoop itself like hands 
And throw away the road. 
The wagons quickened on the streets, 
The thunder hurried slow; 
The lightning showed a yellow beak, 
And then a livid claw. 
The birds put up the bars to nests, 
The cattle fled to barns; 
There came one drop of giant rain, 
And then, as if the hands 
That held the dams had parted hold, 
The waters wrecked the sky 
But overlooked my father's house, 
lust quartering a tree. 
The Wind Didn'T Come From The Orchard—today 
 
The Wind didn't come from the Orchard—today— 
Further than that— 
Nor stop to play with the Hay— 
Nor joggle a Hat— 
He's a transitive fellow—very— 
Rely on that— 
If He leave a Bur at the door 
We know He has climbed a Fir— 
But the Fir is Where—Declare— 
Were you ever there? 
If He brings Odors of Clovers— 
And that is His business—not Ours— 
Then He has been with the Mowers— 
Whetting away the Hours 
To sweet pauses of Hay— 
His Way—of a June Day— 
If He fling Sand, and Pebble— 
Little Boys Hats—and Stubble— 
With an occasional Steeple— 
And a hoarse "Get out of the way, I say," 
Who'd be the fool to stay? 
Would you—Say— 
Would you be the fool to stay? 
The Wind Tapped Like A Tired Man, 
The wind tapped like a tired man, 
And like a host, 'Come in,' 
I boldly answered; entered then 
My residence within 
A rapid, footless guest, 
To offer whom a chair 
Were as impossible as hand 
A sofa to the air. 
No bone had he to bind him, 
His speech was like the push 
Of numerous humming-birds at once 
From a superior bush. 
His countenance a billow, 
His fingers, if he pass, 
Let go a music, as of tunes 
Blown tremulous in glass. 
He visited, still flitting; 
Then, like a timid man, 
Again he tapped- 't was flurriedly-
And I became alone. 
The Wind Took Up The Northern Things 
The Wind took up the Northern Things 
And piled them in the south Then 
gave the East unto the West 
And opening his mouth 
The four Divisions of the Earth 
Did make as to devour 
While everything to corners slunk 
Behind the awful power 
The Wind -unto his Chambers went 
And nature ventured out Her 
subjects scattered into place 
Her systems ranged about 
Again the smoke from Dwellings rose 
The Day abroad was heard How 
intimate, a Tempest past 
The Transport of the Bird 
The Winters Are So Short 
 
The Winters are so short&mdash; 
I'm hardly justified 
In sending all the Birds away&mdash; 
And moving into Pod&mdash; 
Myself&mdash;for scarcely settled&mdash; 
The Phoebes have begun&mdash; 
And then&mdash;it's time to strike my Tent&mdash; 
And open House&mdash;again&mdash; 
It's mostly, interruptions&mdash; 
My Summer&mdash;is despoiled&mdash; 
Because there was a Winter&mdash;once&mdash; 
And al the Cattle&mdash;starved&mdash; 
And so there was a Deluge&mdash; 
And swept the World away&mdash; 
But Ararat's a Legend&mdash;now&mdash; 
And no one credits Noah&mdash; 
The Woodpecker 
His bill an auger is, 
His head, a cap and frill. 
He laboreth at every tree,-A 
worm his utmost goal. 
The Words The Happy Say 
The words the happy say 
Are paltry melody 
But those the silent feel 
Are beautiful— 
The Work Of Her That Went 
The Work of Her that went, 
The Toil of Fellows done In 
Ovens green our Mother bakes, 
By Fires of the Sun. 
The World&Mdash;Feels Dusty 
 
The World&mdash;feels Dusty 
When We stop to Die&mdash; 
We want the Dew&mdash;then&mdash; 
Honors&mdash;taste dry&mdash; 
Flags&mdash;vex a Dying face&mdash; 
But the least Fan 
Stirred by a friend's Hand&mdash; 
Cools&mdash;like the Rain&mdash; 
Mine be the Ministry 
When they Thirst comes&mdash; 
And Hybla Balms&mdash; 
Dews of Thessaly, to fetch&mdash;

World&Mdash;Stands&Mdash;Solemner&Mdash;To Me 
 
The World&mdash;stands&mdash;solemner&mdash;to me&mdash; 
Since I was wed&mdash;to Him&mdash; 
A modesty befits the soul 
That bears another's&mdash;name&mdash; 
A doubt&mdash;if it be fair&mdash;indeed&mdash; 
To wear that perfect&mdash;pearl&mdash; 
The Man&mdash;upon the Woman&mdash;binds&mdash; 
To clasp her soul&mdash;for all&mdash; 
A prayer, that it more angel&mdash;prove&mdash; 
A whiter Gift&mdash;within&mdash; 
To that munificence, that chose&mdash; 
So unadorned&mdash;a Queen&mdash; 
A Gratitude&mdash;that such be true&mdash; 
It had esteemed the Dream&mdash; 
Too beautiful&mdash;for Shape to prove&mdash; 
Or posture&mdash;to redeem! 
The World—stands—solemner—to Me 
 
The World—stands—solemner—to me— 
Since I was wed—to Him— 
A modesty befits the soul 
That bears another's—name— 
A doubt—if it be fair—indeed—

To clasp her soul—for all— 
A prayer, that it more angel—prove— 
A whiter Gift—within— 
To that munificence, that chose—

The Zeroes—taught Us—phosphorous 
 
The Zeroes—taught us—Phosphorous— 
We learned to like the Fire 
By playing Glaciers—when a Boy— 
And Tinder—guessed—by power 
Of Opposite—to balance Odd— 
If White—a Red—must be! 
Paralysis—our Primer—dumb— 
Unto Vitality! 
Their Height In Heaven Comforts Not 
 
Their Height in Heaven comforts not&mdash; 
Their Glory&mdash;nought to me&mdash; 
'Twas best imperfect&mdash;as it was&mdash; 
I'm finite&mdash;I can't see&mdash; 
The House of Supposition&mdash; 
The Glimmering Frontier that 
Skirts the Acres of Perhaps&mdash; 
To Me&mdash;shows insecure&mdash; 
The Wealth I had&mdash;contented me&mdash; 
If 'twas a meaner size&mdash; 
Then I had counted it until 
It pleased my narrow Eyes&mdash; 
Better than larger values&mdash; 
That show however true&mdash; 
This timid life of Evidence 
Keeps pleading&mdash;"I don't know." 
There Are Two Ripenings—one—of Sight 
 
There are two Ripenings—one—of sight— 
Whose forces Spheric wind 
Until the Velvet product 
Drop spicy to the ground— 
A homelier maturing— 
A process in the Bur— 
That teeth of Frosts alone disclose 
In far October Air. 
There Came A Day At Summer's Full 
 
There came a Day at Summer's full, 
Entirely for me&mdash; 
I thought that such were for the Saints, 
Where Resurrections&mdash;be&mdash; 
The Sun, as common, went abroad, 
The flowers, accustomed, blew, 
As if no soul the solstice passed 
That maketh all things new&mdash; 
The time was scarce profaned, by speech&mdash; 
The symbol of a word 
Was needless, as at Sacrament, 
The Wardrobe&mdash;of our Lord&mdash; 
Each was to each The Sealed Church, 
Permitted to commune this&mdash;time&mdash; 
Lest we too awkward show 
At Supper of the Lamb. 
The Hours slid fast&mdash;as Hours will, 
Clutched tight, by greedy hands&mdash; 
So faces on two Decks, look back, 
Bound to opposing lands&mdash; 
And so when all the time had leaked, 
Without external sound 
Each bound the Other's Crucifix&mdash; 
We gave no other Bond&mdash; 
Sufficient troth, that we shall rise&mdash; 
Deposed&mdash;at length, the Grave&mdash; 
To that new Marriage, 
Justified&mdash;through Calvaries of Love&mdash; 
There Came A Wind Like A Bugle 
There cam a Wind like a Bugle It 
quivered through the Grass 
And a Green Chill upon the Heat 
So ominous did pass 
We barred the Windows and the Doors 
As from an Emerald Ghost The 
Doom's electric Moccasin 
The very instant passed On 
a strange Mob of panting Trees 
And Fences fled away 
And Rivers where the Houses ran 
Those looked that lived - that Day The 
Bell within the steeple wild 
The flying tidings told How 
much can come 
And much can go, 
And yet abide the World! 
There comes a warning like a spy 
There comes a warning like a spy 
A shorter breath of Day 
A stealing that is not a stealth 
And Summers are away 
There Is A Finished Feeling 
 
There is a finished feeling 
Experienced at Graves&mdash; 
A leisure of the Future&mdash; 
A Wilderness of Size. 
By Death's bold Exhibition 
Preciser what we are 
And the Eternal function 
Enabled to infer. 
There Is A Flower That Bees Prefer 
 
There is a flower that Bees prefer&mdash; 
And Butterflies&mdash;desire&mdash; 
To gain the Purple Democrat 
The Humming Bird&mdash;aspire&mdash; 
And Whatsoever Insect pass&mdash; 
A Honey bear away 
Proportioned to his several dearth 
And her&mdash;capacity&mdash; 
Her face be rounder than the Moon 
And ruddier than the Gown 
Or Orchis in the Pasture&mdash; 
Or Rhododendron&mdash;worn&mdash; 
She doth not wait for June&mdash; 
Before the World be Green&mdash; 
Her sturdy little Countenance 
Against the Wind&mdash;be seen&mdash; 
Contending with the Grass&mdash; 
Near Kinsman to Herself&mdash; 
For Privilege of Sod and Sun&mdash; 
Sweet Litigants for Life&mdash; 
And when the Hills be full&mdash; 
And newer fashions blow&mdash; 
Doth not retract a single spice 
For pang of jealousy&mdash; 
Her Public&mdash;be the Noon&mdash; 
Her Providence&mdash;the Sun&mdash; 
Her Progress&mdash;by the Bee&mdash;proclaimed&mdash; 
In sovereign&mdash;Swerveless Tune&mdash; 
The Bravest&mdash;of the Host&mdash; 
Surrendering&mdash;the last&mdash; 
Nor even of Defeat&mdash;aware&mdash; 
What cancelled by the Frost&mdash; 
There Is A June When Corn Is Cut 
 
There is a June when Corn is cut 
And Roses in the Seed&mdash; 
A Summer briefer than the first 
But tenderer indeed 
As should a Face supposed the Grave's 
Emerge a single Noon 
In the Vermilion that it wore 
Affect us, and return&mdash; 
Two Seasons, it is said, exist&mdash; 
The Summer of the Just, 
And this of Ours, diversified 
With Prospect, and with Frost&mdash; 
May not our Second with its First 
So infinite compare 
That We but recollect the one 
The other to prefer? 
There Is A Languor Of The Life 
 
There is a Languor of the Life 
More imminent than Pain&mdash; 
'Tis Pain's Successor&mdash;When the Soul 
Has suffered all it can&mdash; 
A Drowsiness&mdash;diffuses&mdash; 
A Dimness like a Fog 
Envelops Consciousness&mdash; 
As Mists&mdash;obliterate a Crag. 
The Surgeon&mdash;does not blanch&mdash;at pain 
His Habit&mdash;is severe&mdash; 
But tell him that it ceased to feel&mdash; 
The Creature lying there&mdash; 
And he will tell you&mdash;skill is late&mdash; 
A Mightier than He&mdash; 
Has ministered before Him&mdash; 
There's no Vitality. 
There Is A Morn By Men Unseen 
 
There is a morn by men unseen&mdash; 
Whose maids upon remoter green 
Keep their Seraphic May&mdash; 
And all day long, with dance and game, 
And gambol I may never name&mdash; 
Employ their holiday. 
Here to light measure, move the feet 
Which walk no more the village street&mdash; 
Nor by the wood are found&mdash; 
Here are the birds that sought the sun 
When last year's distaff idle hung 
And summer's brows were bound. 
Ne'er saw I such a wondrous scene&mdash; 
Ne'er such a ring on such a green&mdash; 
Nor so serene array&mdash; 
As if the stars some summer night 
Should swing their cups of Chrysolite&mdash; 
And revel till the day&mdash; 
Like thee to dance&mdash;like thee to sing&mdash; 
People upon the mystic green&mdash; 
I ask, each new May Morn. 
I wait thy far, fantastic bells&mdash; 
Unto the different dawn! 
There Is A Pain—so Utter 
 
There is a pain—so utter— 
It swallows substance up— 
Then covers the Abyss with Trance— 
So Memory can step 
Around—across—upon it— 
As one within a Swoon— 
Goes safely—where an open eye— 
Would drop Him—Bone by Bone. 
There Is A Shame Of Nobleness 
 
There is a Shame of Nobleness&mdash; 
Confronting Sudden Pelf&mdash; 
A finer Shame of Ecstasy&mdash; 
Convicted of Itself&mdash; 
A best Disgrace&mdash;a Brave Man feels&mdash; 
Acknowledged&mdash;of the Brave&mdash; 
One More&mdash;"Ye Blessed"&mdash;to be told&mdash; 
But that's&mdash;Behind the Grave&mdash; 
There Is A Word 
 
There is a word 
Which bears a sword 
Can pierce an armed man&mdash; 
It hurls its barbed syllables 
And is mute again&mdash; 
But where it fell 
The saved will tell 
On patriotic day, 
Some epauletted Brother 
Gave his breath away. 
Wherever runs the breathless sun&mdash; 
Wherever roams the day&mdash; 
There is its noiseless onset&mdash; 
There is its victory! 
Behold the keenest marksman! 
The most accomplished shot! 
Time's sublimest target 
Is a soul "forgot!" 
There Is An Arid Pleasure 
 
There is an arid Pleasure&mdash; 
As different from Joy&mdash; 
As Frost is different from Dew&mdash; 
Like element&mdash;are they&mdash; 
Yet one&mdash;rejoices Flowers&mdash; 
And one&mdash;the Flowers abhor&mdash; 
The finest Honey&mdash;curdled&mdash; 
Is worthless&mdash;to the Bee&mdash; 
There is another Loneliness 
There is another Loneliness 
That many die without Not 
want of friend occasions it 
Or circumstances of Lot 
But nature, sometimes, sometimes thought 
And whoso it befall 
Is richer than could be revealed 
By mortal numeral 
There Is Another Sky 
There is another sky, 
Ever serene and fair, 
And there is another sunshine, 
Though it be darkness there; 
Never mind faded forests, Austin, 
Never mind silent fields— 
Here is a little forest, 
Whose leaf is ever green; 
Here is a brighter garden, 
Where not a frost has been; 
In its unfading flowers 
I hear the bright bee hum: 
Prithee, my brother, 
Into my garden come! 
There Is No Frigate Like A Book 
There is no frigate like a book 
To take us lands away, 
Nor any coursers like a page 
Of prancing poetry. 
This traverse may the poorest take 
Without oppress of toll; 
How frugal is the chariot 
That bears a human soul! 
There is no Silence in the Earth 
There is no Silence in the Earth -so silent 
As that endured 
Which uttered, would discourage Nature 
And haunt the World. 
There's A Certain Slant Of Light (258) 
There's a certain Slant of light, 
Winter Afternoons-That 
oppresses, like the Heft 
Of Cathedral Tunes-
Heavenly Hurt, it gives us-We 
can find no scar, 
But internal difference, 
Where the Meanings, are-
None may teach it--Any-'
Tis the Seal Despair-An 
imperial affliction 
Sent us of the air-
When it comes, the Landscape listens-Shadows--
hold their breath-When 
it goes, 'tis like the Distance 
On the look of Death-
There's Been A Death In The Opposite House 
There's been a death in the opposite house 
As lately as to-day. 
I know it by the numb look 
Such houses have alway. 
The neighbors rustle in and out, 
The doctor drives away. 
A window opens like a pod, 
Abrupt, mechanically; 
Somebody flings a mattress out,-The 
children hurry by; 
They wonder if It died on that,-I 
used to when a boy. 
The minister goes stiffly in 
As if the house were his, 
And he owned all the mourners now, 
And little boys besides; 
And then the milliner, and the man 
Of the appalling trade, 
To take the measure of the house. 
There'll be that dark parade 
Of tassels and of coaches soon; 
It's easy as a sign,-
The intuition of the news 
In just a country town. 
There's Something Quieter Than Sleep 
 
There's something quieter than sleep 
Within this inner room! 
It wears a sprig upon its breast&mdash; 
And will not tell its name. 
Some touch it, and some kiss it&mdash; 
Some chafe its idle hand&mdash; 
It has a simple gravity 
I do not understand! 
I would not weep if I were they&mdash; 
How rude in one to sob! 
Might scare the quiet fairy 
Back to her native wood! 
While simple-hearted neighbors 
Chat of the "Early dead"&mdash; 
We&mdash;prone to periphrasis 
Remark that Birds have fled! 
These Are The Days When Birds Come Back 
 
These are the days when Birds come back&mdash; 
A very few&mdash;a Bird or two&mdash; 
To take a backward look. 
These are the days when skies resume 
The old&mdash;old sophistries of June&mdash; 
A blue and gold mistake. 
Oh fraud that cannot cheat the Bee&mdash; 
Almost thy plausibility 
Induces my belief. 
Till ranks of seeds their witness bear&mdash; 
And softly thro' the altered air 
Hurries a timid leaf. 
Oh Sacrament of summer days, 
Oh Last Communion in the Haze&mdash; 
Permit a child to join. 
Thy sacred emblems to partake&mdash; 
They consecrated bread to take 
And thine immortal wine! 
These Fevered Days -to take them to the Forest 
These Fevered Days -to take them to the Forest 
Where Waters cool around the mosses crawl And 
shade is all that devastates the stillness 
Seems it sometimes this would be all 
These Tested Our Horizon 
 
These tested Our Horizon&mdash; 
Then disappeared 
As Birds before achieving 
A Latitude. 
Our Retrospection of Them 
A fixed Delight, 
But our Anticipation 
A Dice&mdash;a Doubt&mdash; 
These—saw Visions 
 
These—saw Visions— 
Latch them softly— 
These—held Dimples— 
Smooth them slow— 
This—addressed departing accents— 
Quick—Sweet Mouth—to miss thee so— 
This—We stroked— 
Unnumbered Satin— 
These—we held among our own— 
Fingers of the Slim Aurora— 
Not so arrogant—this Noon— 
These—adjust—that ran to meet us— 
Pearl—for Stocking—Pearl for Shoe— 
Paradise—the only Palace 
Fit for Her reception—now— 
They Ask But Our Delight 
 
They ask but our Delight&mdash; 
The Darlings of the Soil 
And grant us all their Countenance 
For a penurious smile. 
They Called Me To The Window, For 
 
They called me to the Window, for 
" 'Twas Sunset"&mdash;Some one said&mdash; 
I only saw a Sapphire Farm&mdash; 
And just a Single Herd&mdash; 
Of Opal Cattle&mdash;feeding far 
Upon so vain a Hill&mdash; 
As even while I looked&mdash;dissolved&mdash; 
Nor Cattle were&mdash;nor Soil&mdash; 
But in their stead&mdash;a Sea&mdash;displayed&mdash; 
And Ships&mdash;of such a size 
As Crew of Mountains&mdash;could afford&mdash; 
And Decks&mdash;to seat the skies&mdash; 
This&mdash;too&mdash;the Showman rubbed away&mdash; 
And when I looked again&mdash; 
Nor Farm&mdash;nor Opal Herd&mdash;was there&mdash; 
Nor Mediterranean&mdash; 
They Dropped Like Flakes 
They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars, 
Like petals from a rose, 
When suddenly across the lune 
A wind with fingers goes. 
They perished in the seamless grass,-No 
eye could find the place; 
But God on his repealless list 
Can summon every face 
They Have A Little Odor—that To Me 
 
They have a little Odor—that to me 
Is metre—nay—'tis melody— 
And spiciest at fading—indicate— 
A Habit—of a Laureate— 
'They Have Not Chosen Me,' He Said 
'They have not chosen me,' he said, 
'But I have chosen them!' 
Brave—Broken hearted statement— 
Uttered in Bethlehem! 
I could not have told it, 
But since Jesus dared— 
Sovereign! Know a Daisy 
They dishonor shared! 
They Leave Us With The Infinite 
 
They leave us with the Infinite. 
But He&mdash;is not a man&mdash; 
His fingers are the size of fists&mdash; 
His fists, the size of men&mdash; 
And whom he foundeth, with his Arm 
As Himmaleh, shall stand&mdash; 
Gibraltar's Everlasting Shoe 
Poised lightly on his Hand, 
So trust him, Comrade&mdash; 
You for you, and I, for you and me 
Eternity is ample, 
And quick enough, if true. 
They Put Us Far Apart 
 
They put Us far apart&mdash; 
As separate as Sea 
And Her unsown Peninsula&mdash; 
We signified "These see"&mdash; 
They took away our Eyes&mdash; 
They thwarted Us with Guns&mdash; 
"I see Thee" each responded straight 
Through Telegraphic Signs&mdash; 
With Dungeons&mdash;They devised&mdash; 
But through their thickest skill&mdash; 
And their opaquest Adamant&mdash; 
Our Souls saw&mdash;just as well&mdash; 
They summoned Us to die&mdash; 
With sweet alacrity 
We stood upon our stapled feet&mdash; 
Condemned&mdash;but just&mdash;to see&mdash; 
Permission to recant&mdash; 
Permission to forget&mdash; 
We turned our backs upon the Sun 
For perjury of that&mdash; 
Not Either&mdash;noticed Death&mdash; 
Of Paradise&mdash;aware&mdash; 
Each other's Face&mdash;was all the Disc 
Each other's setting&mdash;saw&mdash; 
They Say That 'Time Assuages, 
They say that 'time assuages,'-Time 
never did assuage; 
An actual suffering strengthens, 
As sinews do, with age. 
Time is a test of trouble, 
But not a remedy. 
If such it prove, it prove too 
There was no malady. 
They Shut Me Up In Prose 
They shut me up in Prose -As 
when a little Girl 
They put me in the Closet -Because 
they liked me "still" -
Still! Could themself have peeped -And 
seen my Brain -- go round -They 
might as wise have lodged a Bird 
For Treason -- in the Pound -
Himself has but to will 
And easy as a Star 
Abolish his Captivity -And 
laugh -- No more have I -
They Won'T Frown Always—some Sweet Day 
 
They won't frown always—some sweet Day 
When I forget to tease— 
They'll recollect how cold I looked 
And how I just said "Please." 
Then They will hasten to the Door 
To call the little Girl 
Who cannot thank Them for the Ice 
That filled the lisping full. 
This Bauble Was Preferred Of Bees 
 
This Bauble was preferred of Bees&mdash; 
By Butterflies admired 
At Heavenly&mdash;Hopeless Distances&mdash; 
Was justified of Bird&mdash; 
Did Noon&mdash;enamel&mdash;in Herself 
Was Summer to a Score 
Who only knew of Universe&mdash; 
It had created Her. 
This Chasm, Sweet, Upon My Life 
 
This Chasm, Sweet, upon my life 
I mention it to you, 
When Sunrise through a fissure drop 
The Day must follow too. 
If we demur, its gaping sides 
Disclose as 'twere a Tomb 
Ourself am lying straight wherein 
The Favorite of Doom. 
When it has just contained a Life 
Then, Darling, it will close 
And yet so bolder every Day 
So turbulent it grows 
I'm tempted half to stitch it up 
With a remaining Breath 
I should not miss in yielding, though 
To Him, it would be Death&mdash; 
And so I bear it big about 
My Burial&mdash;before 
A Life quite ready to depart 
Can harass me no more&mdash; 
This Consciousness That Is Aware 
 
This Consciousness that is aware 
Of Neighbors and the Sun 
Will be the one aware of Death 
And that itself alone 
Is traversing the interval 
Experience between 
And most profound experiment 
Appointed unto Men&mdash; 
How adequate unto itself 
Its properties shall be 
Itself unto itself and none 
Shall make discovery. 
Adventure most unto itself 
The Soul condemned to be&mdash; 
Attended by a single Hound 
Its own identity. 
This Dust, And Its Feature 
 
This Dust, and its Feature&mdash; 
Accredited&mdash;Today&mdash; 
Will in a second Future&mdash; 
Cease to identify&mdash; 
This Mind, and its measure&mdash; 
A too minute Area 
For its enlarged inspection's 
Comparison&mdash;appear&mdash; 
This World, and its species 
A too concluded show 
For its absorbed Attention's 
Remotest scrutiny&mdash; 
This Heart That Broke So Long 
 
This heart that broke so long&mdash; 
These feet that never flagged&mdash; 
This faith that watched for star in vain, 
Give gently to the dead&mdash; 
Hound cannot overtake the Hare 
That fluttered panting, here&mdash; 
Nor any schoolboy rob the nest 
Tenderness builded there. 
This Is A Blossom Of The Brain 
 
This is a Blossom of the Brain&mdash; 
A small&mdash;italic Seed 
Lodged by Design or Happening 
The Spirit fructified&mdash; 
Shy as the Wind of his Chambers 
Swift as a Freshet's Tongue 
So of the Flower of the Soul 
Its process is unknown. 
When it is found, a few rejoice 
The Wise convey it Home 
Carefully cherishing the spot 
If other Flower become. 
When it is lost, that Day shall be 
The Funeral of God, 
Upon his Breast, a closing Soul 
The Flower of our Lord. 
This Is My Letter To The World, 
This is my letter to the world, 
That never wrote to me,
The simple news that Nature told, 
With tender majesty 
Her message is committed 
To hands I cannot see; 
For love of her, sweet countrymen, 
Judge tenderly of me! 
This Is The Land The Sunset Washes, 
This is the land the sunset washes, 
These are the banks of the Yellow Sea; 
Where it rose, or whither it rushes, 
These are the western mystery! 
Night after night her purple traffic 
Strews the landing with opal bales; 
Merchantmen poise upon horizons, 
Dip, and vanish with fairy sails. 
This Merit Hath The Worst 
 
This Merit hath the worst&mdash; 
It cannot be again&mdash; 
When Fate hath taunted last 
And thrown Her furthest Stone&mdash; 
The Maimed may pause, and breathe, 
And glance securely round&mdash; 
The Deer attracts no further 
Than it resists&mdash;the Hound&mdash; 
This Quiet Dust Was Gentlemen And Ladies 
This quiet dust was gentlemen and ladies 
And lads and girls; 
Was laughter and ability and sighing, 
And frocks and curls; 
This passive place a summer's nimble mansion, 
Where bloom and bees 
Fulfilled their oriental circuit, 
Then ceased like these. 
This That Would Greet&Mdash;An Hour Ago 
 
This that would greet&mdash;an hour ago&mdash; 
Is quaintest Distance&mdash;now&mdash; 
Had it a Guest from Paradise&mdash; 
Nor glow, would it, nor bow&mdash; 
Had it a notice from the Noon 
Nor beam would it nor warm&mdash; 
Match me the Silver Reticence&mdash; 
Match me the Solid Calm&mdash; 
This Was A Poet&Mdash;It Is That 
 
This was a Poet&mdash;It is That 
Distills amazing sense 
From ordinary Meanings&mdash; 
And Attar so immense 
From the familiar species 
That perished by the Door&mdash; 
We wonder it was not Ourselves 
Arrested it&mdash;before&mdash; 
Of Pictures, the Discloser&mdash; 
The Poet&mdash;it is He&mdash; 
Entitles Us&mdash;by Contrast&mdash; 
To ceaseless Poverty&mdash; 
Of portion&mdash;so unconscious&mdash; 
The Robbing&mdash;could not harm&mdash; 
Himself&mdash;to Him&mdash;a Fortune&mdash; 
Exterior&mdash;to Time&mdash; 
This Was In The White Of The Year 
 
This was in the White of the Year&mdash; 
That&mdash;was in the Green&mdash; 
Drifts were as difficult then to think 
As Daisies now to be seen&mdash; 
Looking back is best that is left 
Or if it be&mdash;before&mdash; 
Retrospection is Prospect's half, 
Sometimes, almost more. 
This World Is Not Conclusion 
 
This World is not Conclusion. 
A Species stands beyond&mdash; 
Invisible, as Music&mdash; 
But positive, as Sound&mdash; 
It beckons, and it baffles&mdash; 
Philosophy&mdash;don't know&mdash; 
And through a Riddle, at the last&mdash; 
Sagacity, must go&mdash; 
To guess it, puzzles scholars&mdash; 
To gain it, Men have borne 
Contempt of Generations 
And Crucifixion, shown&mdash; 
Faith slips&mdash;and laughs, and rallies&mdash; 
Blushes, if any see&mdash; 
Plucks at a twig of Evidence&mdash; 
And asks a Vane, the way&mdash; 
Much Gesture, from the Pulpit&mdash; 
Strong Hallelujahs roll&mdash; 
Narcotics cannot still the Tooth 
That nibbles at the soul&mdash; 
This&Mdash;Is The Land&Mdash;The Sunset Washes 
 
This&mdash;is the land&mdash;the Sunset washes&mdash; 
These&mdash;are the Banks of the Yellow Sea&mdash; 
Where it rose&mdash;or whither it rushes&mdash; 
These&mdash;are the Western Mystery! 
Night after Night 
Her purple traffic 
Strews the landing with Opal Bales&mdash; 
Merchantmen&mdash;poise upon Horizons&mdash; 
Dip&mdash;and vanish like Orioles! 
Tho' I Get Home How Late—how Late 
 
Tho' I get home how late—how late— 
So I get home - 'twill compensate— 
Better will be the Ecstasy 
That they have done expecting me— 
When Night—descending—dumb—and dark— 
They hear my unexpected knock— 
Transporting must the moment be— 
Brewed from decades of Agony! 
To think just how the fire will burn— 
Just how long-cheated eyes will turn— 
To wonder what myself will say, 
And what itself, will say to me— 
Beguiles the Centuries of way! 
Tho' My Destiny Be Fustian 
 
Tho' my destiny be Fustian&mdash; 
Hers be damask fine&mdash; 
Tho' she wear a silver apron&mdash; 
I, a less divine&mdash; 
Still, my little Gypsy being 
I would far prefer, 
Still, my little sunburnt bosom 
To her Rosier, 
For, when Frosts, their punctual fingers 
On her forehead lay, 
You and I, and Dr. Holland, 
Bloom Eternally! 
Roses of a steadfast summer 
In a steadfast land, 
Where no Autumn lifts her pencil&mdash; 
And no Reapers stand! 
Those Fair—fictitious People 
 
Those fair—fictitious People— 
The Women—plucked away 
From our familiar Lifetime— 
The Men of Ivory— 
Those Boys and Girls, in Canvas— 
Who stay upon the Wall 
In Everlasting Keepsake— 
Can Anybody tell? 
We trust—in places perfecter— 
Inheriting Delight 
Beyond our faint Conjecture— 
Our dizzy Estimate— 
Remembering ourselves, we trust— 
Yet Blesseder—than We— 
Through Knowing—where We only hope— 
Receiving—where we—pray— 
Of Expectation—also— 
Anticipating us 
With transport, that would be a pain 
Except for Holiness— 
Esteeming us—as Exile— 
Themself—admitted Home— 
Through easy Miracle of Death— 
The Way ourself, must come— 
Those Who Have Been In The Grave The Longest 
 
Those who have been in the Grave the longest&mdash; 
Those who begin Today&mdash; 
Equally perish from our Practise&mdash; 
Death is the other way&mdash; 
Foot of the Bold did least attempt it&mdash; 
It&mdash;is the White Exploit&mdash; 
Once to achieve, annuls the power 
Once to communicate&mdash; 
Three Times—we Parted—breath—and I 
 
Three times—we parted—Breath—and I— 
Three times—He would not go— 
But strove to stir the lifeless Fan 
The Waters—strove to stay. 
Three Times—the Billows tossed me up— 
Then caught me—like a Ball— 
Then made Blue faces in my face— 
And pushed away a sail 
That crawled Leagues off—I liked to see— 
For thinking—while I die— 
How pleasant to behold a Thing 
Where Human faces—be— 
The Waves grew sleepy—Breath—did not— 
The Winds—like Children—lulled— 
Then Sunrise kissed my Chrysalis— 
And I stood up—and lived— 
Through Lane It Lay—through Bramble 
 
Through lane it lay—through bramble— 
Through clearing and through wood— 
Banditti often passed us 
Upon the lonely road. 
The wolf came peering curious— 
The owl looked puzzled down— 
The serpent's satin figure 
Glid stealthily along— 
The tempests touched our garments— 
The lightning's poinards gleamed— 
Fierce from the Crag above us 
The hungry Vulture screamed— 
The satyr's fingers beckoned— 
The valley murmured "Come"— 
These were the mates— 
This was the road 
Those children fluttered home. 
Through The Dark Sod—as Education 
Through the Dark Sod—as Education— 
The Lily passes sure— 
Feels her white foot—no trepidation— 
Her faith—no fear— 
Afterward—in the Meadow— 
Swinging her Beryl Bell— 
The Mold-life—all forgotten—now— 
In Ecstasy—and Dell— 
Through The Strait Pass Of Suffering 
 
Through the strait pass of suffering&mdash; 
The Martyrs&mdash;even&mdash;trod. 
Their feet&mdash;upon Temptations&mdash; 
Their faces&mdash;upon God&mdash; 
A stately&mdash;shriven&mdash;Company&mdash; 
Convulsion&mdash;playing round&mdash; 
Harmless&mdash;as streaks of Meteor&mdash; 
Upon a Planet's Bond&mdash; 
Their faith&mdash;the everlasting troth&mdash; 
Their Expectation&mdash;fair&mdash; 
The Needle&mdash;to the North Degree&mdash; 
Wades&mdash;so&mdash;thro' polar Air! 
Tie The Strings To My Life, My Lord, 
Tie the strings to my life, my Lord, 
Then I am ready to go! 
Just a look at the horses -Rapid! 
That will do! 
Put me in on the firmest side, 
So I shall never fall; 
For we must ride to the Judgment, 
And it's partly down hill. 
But never I mind the bridges, 
And never I mind the sea; 
Held fast in everlasting race 
By my own choice and thee. 
Good-by to the life I used to lives, 
And the world I used to know; 
And kiss the hills for me, just once; 
Now I am ready to go! 
Till Death—is Narrow Loving 
 
Till Death—is narrow Loving— 
The scantest Heart extant 
Will hold you till your privilege 
Of Finiteness—be spent— 
But He whose loss procures you 
Such Destitution that 
Your Life too abject for itself 
Thenceforward imitate— 
Until—Resemblance perfect— 
Yourself, for His pursuit 
Delight of Nature—abdicate— 
Exhibit Love—somewhat— 
Time Feels So Vast That Were It Not 
 
Time feels so vast that were it not 
For an Eternity&mdash; 
I fear me this Circumference 
Engross my Finity&mdash; 
To His exclusion, who prepare 
By Processes of Size 
For the Stupendous Vision 
Of his diameters&mdash; 
'Tis Anguish Grander Than Delight 
 
'Tis Anguish grander than Delight 
'Tis Resurrection Pain&mdash; 
The meeting Bands of smitten Face 
We questioned to, again. 
'Tis Transport wild as thrills the Graves 
When Cerements let go 
And Creatures clad in Miracle 
Go up by Two and Two. 
'Tis Customary As We Part 
 
'Tis customary as we part 
A trinket&mdash;to confer&mdash; 
It helps to stimulate the faith 
When Lovers be afar&mdash; 
'Tis various&mdash;as the various taste&mdash; 
Clematis&mdash;journeying far&mdash; 
Presents me with a single Curl 
Of her Electric Hair&mdash; 
'Tis Good&Mdash;The Looking Back On Grief 
 
'Tis good&mdash;the looking back on Grief&mdash; 
To re-endure a Day&mdash; 
We thought the Mighty Funeral&mdash; 
Of All Conceived Joy&mdash; 
To recollect how Busy Grass 
Did meddle&mdash;one by one&mdash; 
Till all the Grief with Summer&mdash;waved 
And none could see the stone. 
And though the Woe you have Today 
Be larger&mdash;As the Sea 
Exceeds its Unremembered Drop&mdash; 
They're Water&mdash;equally&mdash; 
'Tis Little I—could Care For Pearls 
 
'Tis little I—could care for Pearls— 
Who own the ample sea— 
Or Brooches—when the Emperor— 
With Rubies—pelteth me— 
Or Gold—who am the Prince of Mines— 
Or Diamonds—when have I 
A Diadem to fit a Dom— 
Continual upon me— 
'Tis Not That Dying Hurts Us So 
 
'Tis not that Dying hurts us so&mdash; 
'Tis Living&mdash;hurts us more&mdash; 
But Dying&mdash;is a different way&mdash; 
A Kind behind the Door&mdash; 
The Southern Custom&mdash;of the Bird&mdash; 
That ere the Frosts are due&mdash; 
Accepts a better Latitude&mdash; 
We&mdash;are the Birds&mdash;that stay. 
The Shrivers round Farmers' doors&mdash; 
For whose reluctant Crumb&mdash; 
We stipulate&mdash;till pitying Snows 
Persuade our Feathers Home. 
'Tis One By One — The Father Counts 
 
'Tis One by One — the Father counts — 
And then a Tract between 
Set Cypherless — to teach the Eye 
The Value of its Ten — 
Until the peevish Student 
Acquire the Quick of Skill — 
Then Numerals are dowered back — 
Adorning all the Rule — 
'Tis mostly Slate and Pencil — 
And Darkness on the School 
Distracts the Children's fingers — 
Still the Eternal Rule 
Regards least Cypherer alike 
With Leader of the Band — 
And every separate Urchin's Sum — 
Is fashioned for his hand — 
'Tis Opposites&Mdash;Entice 
 
'Tis Opposites&mdash;entice&mdash; 
Deformed Men&mdash;ponder Grace&mdash; 
Bright fires&mdash;the Blanketless&mdash; 
The Lost&mdash;Day's face&mdash;

Enough Estate&mdash;to see&mdash;

Tho' the Divinity&mdash; 
Be only 
Me&mdash; 
'Tis So Appalling&Mdash;It Exhilarates 
 
'Tis so appalling&mdash;it exhilarates&mdash; 
So over Horror, it half Captivates&mdash; 
The Soul stares after it, secure&mdash; 
A Sepulchre, fears frost, no more&mdash; 
To scan a Ghost, is faint&mdash; 
But grappling, conquers it&mdash; 
How easy, Torment, now&mdash; 
Suspense kept sawing so&mdash; 
The Truth, is Bald, and Cold&mdash; 
But that will hold&mdash; 
If any are not sure&mdash; 
We show them&mdash;prayer&mdash; 
But we, who know, 
Stop hoping, now&mdash; 
Looking at Death, is Dying&mdash; 
Just let go the Breath&mdash; 
And not the pillow at your Cheek 
So Slumbereth&mdash; 
Others, Can wrestle&mdash; 
Yours, is done&mdash; 
And so of Woe, bleak dreaded&mdash;come, 
It sets the Fright at liberty&mdash; 
And Terror's free&mdash; 
Gay, Ghastly, Holiday! 
'Tis So Much Joy! 
 
'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy! 
If I should fail, what poverty! 
And yet, as poor as I, 
Have ventured all upon a throw! 
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so— 
This side the Victory! 
Life is but Life! And Death, but Death! 
Bliss is, but Bliss, and Breath but Breath! 
And if indeed I fail, 
At least, to know the worst, is sweet! 
Defeat means nothing but Defeat, 
No drearier, can befall! 
And if I gain! Oh Gun at Sea! 
Oh Bells, that in the Steeples be! 
At first, repeat it slow! 
For Heaven is a different thing, 
Conjectured, and waked sudden in— 
And might extinguish me! 
'Tis Sunrise&Mdash;Little Maid&Mdash;Hast Thou 
 
'Tis Sunrise&mdash;Little Maid&mdash;Hast Thou 
No Station in the Day? 
'Twas not thy wont, to hinder so&mdash; 
Retrieve thine industry&mdash; 
'Tis Noon&mdash;My little Maid&mdash; 
Alas&mdash;and art thou sleeping yet? 
The Lily&mdash;waiting to be Wed&mdash; 
The Bee&mdash;Hast thou forgot? 
My little Maid&mdash;'Tis Night&mdash;Alas 
That Night should be to thee 
Instead of Morning&mdash;Had'st thou broached 
Thy little Plan to Die&mdash; 
Dissuade thee, if I could not, Sweet, 
I might have aided&mdash;thee&mdash; 
'Tis True—they Shut Me In The Cold 
 
'Tis true—They shut me in the Cold— 
But then—Themselves were warm 
And could not know the feeling 'twas— 
Forget it—Lord—of Them— 
Let not my Witness hinder Them 
In Heavenly esteem— 
No Paradise could be—Conferred 
Through Their beloved Blame— 
The Harm They did—was short—And since 
Myself—who bore it—do— 
Forgive Them—Even as Myself— 
Or else—forgive not me— 
To Be Alive—is Power 
 
To be alive—is Power— 
Existence—in itself— 
Without a further function— 
Omnipotence—Enough— 
To be alive—and Will! 
'Tis able as a God— 
The Maker—of Ourselves—be what— 
Such being Finitude! 
To Die 
To die--takes just a little while-They 
say it doesn't hurt-It's 
only fainter--by degrees-And 
then--it's out of sight-
A darker Ribbon--for a Day-A 
Crape upon the Hat-And 
then the pretty sunshine comes-And 
helps us to forget-
The absent--mystic--creature-That 
but for love of us-Had 
gone to sleep--that soundest time-Without 
the weariness-
To Die—takes Just A Little While 
To die—takes just a little while— 
They say it doesn't hurt— 
It's only fainter—by degrees— 
And then—it's out of sight— 
A darker Ribbon—for a Day— 
A Crape upon the Hat— 
And then the pretty sunshine comes— 
And helps us to forget—

That but for love of us— 
Had gone to sleep—that soundest time— 
Without the weariness— 
To Fight Aloud, Is Very Brave 
 
To fight aloud, is very brave&mdash; 
But gallanter, I know 
Who charge within the bosom 
The Cavalry of Woe&mdash; 
Who win, and nations do not see&mdash; 
Who fall&mdash;and none observe&mdash; 
Whose dying eyes, no Country 
Regards with patriot love&mdash; 
We trust, in plumed procession 
For such, the Angels go&mdash; 
Rank after Rank, with even feet&mdash; 
And Uniforms of Snow. 
To Fill A Gap 
 
To fill a Gap 
Insert the Thing that caused it&mdash; 
Block it up 
With Other&mdash;and 'twill yawn the more&mdash; 
You cannot solder an Abyss 
With Air. 
To Flee From Memory 
To flee from memory 
Had we the Wings 
Many would fly 
Inured to slower things 
Birds with surprise 
Would scan the cowering Van 
Of men escaping 
From the mind of man 
To Hang Our Head&Mdash;Ostensibly 
 
To hang our head&mdash;ostensibly&mdash; 
And subsequent, to find 
That such was not the posture 
Of our immortal mind&mdash; 
Affords the sly presumption 
That in so dense a fuzz&mdash; 
You&mdash;too&mdash;take Cobweb attitudes 
Upon a plane of Gauze! 
To Hear An Oriole Sing 
 
To hear an Oriole sing 
May be a common thing&mdash; 
Or only a divine. 
It is not of the Bird 
Who sings the same, unheard, 
As unto Crowd&mdash; 
The Fashion of the Ear 
Attireth that it hear 
In Dun, or fair&mdash; 
So whether it be Rune, 
Or whether it be none 
Is of within. 
The "Tune is in the Tree&mdash;" 
The Skeptic&mdash;showeth me&mdash; 
"No Sir! In Thee!" 
To Interrupt His Yellow Plan 
 
To interrupt His Yellow Plan 
The Sun does not allow 
Caprices of the Atmosphere&mdash; 
And even when the Snow 
Heaves Balls of Specks, like Vicious Boy 
Directly in His Eye&mdash; 
Does not so much as turn His Head 
Busy with Majesty&mdash; 
'Tis His to stimulate the Earth&mdash; 
And magnetize the Sea&mdash; 
And bind Astronomy, in place, 
Yet Any passing by 
Would deem Ourselves&mdash;the busier 
As the Minutest Bee 
That rides&mdash;emits a Thunder&mdash; 
A Bomb&mdash;to justify&mdash; 
To Know Just How He Suffered—Would Be Dear 
 
To know just how He suffered—would be dear— 
To know if any Human eyes were near 
To whom He could entrust His wavering gaze— 
Until it settle broad—on Paradise— 
To know if He was patient—part content— 
Was Dying as He thought—or different— 
Was it a pleasant Day to die— 
And did the Sunshine face his way— 
What was His furthest mind—Of Home—or God— 
Or what the Distant say— 
At news that He ceased Human Nature 
Such a Day— 
And Wishes—Had He Any— 
Just His Sigh—Accented— 
Had been legible—to Me— 
And was He Confident until 
Ill fluttered out—in Everlasting Well— 
And if He spoke—What name was Best— 
What last 
What One broke off with 
At the Drowsiest— 
Was He afraid—or tranquil— 
Might He know 
How Conscious Consciousness—could grow— 
Till Love that was—and Love too best to be— 
Meet—and the Junction be Eternity 
To Learn The Transport By The Pain 
 
To learn the Transport by the Pain 
As Blind Men learn the sun! 
To die of thirst&mdash;suspecting 
That Brooks in Meadows run! 
To stay the homesick&mdash;homesick feet 
Upon a foreign shore&mdash; 
Haunted by native lands, the while&mdash; 
And blue&mdash;beloved air! 
This is the Sovereign Anguish! 
This&mdash;the signal woe! 
These are the patient "Laureates" 
Whose voices&mdash;trained&mdash;below&mdash; 
Ascend in ceaseless Carol&mdash; 
Inaudible, indeed, 
To us&mdash;the duller scholars 
Of the Mysterious Bard! 
To Lose One's Faith&Mdash;Surpass 
 
To lose one's faith&mdash;surpass 
The loss of an Estate&mdash; 
Because Estates can be 
Replenished&mdash;faith cannot&mdash; 
Inherited with Life&mdash; 
Belief&mdash;but once&mdash;can be&mdash; 
Annihilate a single clause&mdash; 
And Being's&mdash;Beggary&mdash; 
To Lose Thee 
To lose thee, sweeter than to gain 
All other hearts I knew. 
Tis true the drought is destitute 
But, then, I had the dew! 
The Caspian has its realms of sand, 
Its other realm of sea. 
Without this sterile perquisite 
No Caspian could be. 
To Love Thee Year By Year 
 
To love thee Year by Year&mdash; 
May less appear 
Than sacrifice, and cease&mdash; 
However, dear, 
Forever might be short, I thought to show&mdash; 
And so I pieced it, with a flower, now. 
To Make A Prairie (1755) 
To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, 
One clover, and a bee. 
And revery. 
The revery alone will do, 
If bees are few. 
To Make One's Toilette&Mdash;After Death 
 
To make One's Toilette&mdash;after Death 
Has made the Toilette cool 
Of only Taste we cared to please 
Is difficult, and still&mdash; 
That's easier&mdash;than Braid the Hair&mdash; 
And make the Bodice gay&mdash; 
When eyes that fondled it are wrenched 
By Decalogues&mdash;away&mdash; 
To Mend Each Tattered Faith 
To mend each tattered Faith 
There is a needle fair 
Though no appearance indicate 
'Tis threaded in the Air 
And though it do not wear 
As if it never Tore 
'Tis very comfortable indeed 
And spacious as before 
To My Quick Ear The Leaves Conferred; 
To my quick ear the leaves conferred; 
The bushes they were bells; 
I could not find a privacy 
From Nature's sentinels. 
In cave if I presumed to hide, 
The walls began to tell; 
Creation seemed a mighty crack 
To make me visible. 
To My Small Hearth His Fire Came 
 
To my small Hearth His fire came&mdash; 
And all my House aglow 
Did fan and rock, with sudden light&mdash; 
'Twas Sunrise&mdash;'twas the Sky&mdash; 
Impanelled from no Summer brief&mdash; 
With limit of Decay&mdash; 
'Twas Noon&mdash;without the News of Night&mdash; 
Nay, Nature, it was Day&mdash; 
To Offer Brave Assistance 
 
To offer brave assistance 
To Lives that stand alone&mdash; 
When One has failed to stop them&mdash; 
Is Human&mdash;but Divine 
To lend an Ample Sinew 
Unto a Nameless Man&mdash; 
Whose Homely Benediction 
No other&mdash;stopped to earn&mdash; 
To One Denied The Drink 
 
To One denied the drink 
To tell what Water is 
Would be acuter, would it not 
Than letting Him surmise? 
To lead Him to the Well 
And let Him hear it drip 
Remind Him, would it not, somewhat 
Of His condemned lip? 
To Own The Art Within The Soul 
 
To own the Art within the Soul 
The Soul to entertain 
With Silence as a Company 
And Festival maintain 
Is an unfurnished Circumstance 
Possession is to One 
As an Estate perpetual 
Or a reduceless Mine. 
To Put This World Down, Like A Bundle 
 
To put this World down, like a Bundle&mdash; 
And walk steady, away, 
Requires Energy&mdash;possibly Agony&mdash; 
'Tis the Scarlet way 
Trodden with straight renunciation 
By the Son of God&mdash; 
Later, his faint Confederates 
Justify the Road&mdash; 
Flavors of that old Crucifixion&mdash; 
Filaments of Bloom, Pontius Pilate sowed&mdash; 
Strong Clusters, from Barabbas' Tomb&mdash; 
Sacrament, Saints partook before us&mdash; 
Patent, every drop, 
With the Brand of the Gentile Drinker 
Who indorsed the Cup&mdash; 
To See Her Is A Picture 
To see her is a Picture — 
To hear her is a Tune — 
To know her an Intemperance 
As innocent as June — 
To know her not — Affliction — 
To own her for a Friend 
A warmth as near as if the Sun 
Were shining in your Hand. 
To the bright east she flies, 
To the bright east she flies, 
Brothers of Paradise 
Remit her home, 
Without a change of wings, 
Or Love's convenient things, 
Enticed to come. 
Fashioning what she is, 
Fathoming what she was, 
We deem we dream And 
that dissolves the days 
Through which existence strays 
Homeless at home. 
To This World She Returned 
 
To this World she returned. 
But with a tinge of that&mdash; 
A Compound manner, 
As a Sod 
Espoused a Violet, 
That chiefer to the Skies 
Than to himself, allied, 
Dwelt hesitating, half of Dust, 
And half of Day, the Bride. 
To Venerate The Simple Days 
 
To venerate the simple days 
Which lead the seasons by, 
Needs but to remember 
That from you or I, 
They may take the trifle 
Termed mortality! 
To Wait An Hour—is Long 
 
To wait an Hour—is long— 
If Love be just beyond— 
To wait Eternity—is short— 
If Love reward the end— 
'Tomorrow' -whose location 
'Tomorrow' -whose location 
The Wise deceives 
Though its hallucination 
Is last that leaves Tomorrow 
-thou Retriever 
Of every tare Of 
Alibi art thou 
Or ownest where? 
Too cold is this 
Too cold is this 
To warm with Sun Too 
stiff to bended be, 
To joint this Agate were a work -
Outstaring Masonry 
How went the Agile Kernel out 
Contusion of the Husk 
Nor Rip, nor wrinkle indicate 
But just an Asterisk. 
Too Little Way The House Must Lie 
 
Too little way the House must lie 
From every Human Heart 
That holds in undisputed Lease 
A white inhabitant&mdash; 
Too narrow is the Right between&mdash; 
Too imminent the chance&mdash; 
Each Consciousness must emigrate 
And lose its neighbor once&mdash; 
Train 
I like to see it lap the miles, 
And lick the valleys up, 
And stop to feed itself at tanks; 
And then, prodigious, step 
Around a pile of mountains, 
And, supercilious, peer 
In shanties by the sides of roads; 
And then a quarry pare 
To fit its sides, and crawl between, 
Complaining all the while 
In horrid, hooting stanza; 
Then chase itself down the hill 
And neigh like Boanerges; 
Then, punctual as a star, 
Stop - docile and omnipotent At 
its own stable door. 
Triumph—may Be Of Several Kinds 
 
Triumph—may be of several kinds— 
There's Triumph in the Room 
When that Old Imperator—Death— 
By Faith 
Trust In The Unexpected 
 
Trust in the Unexpected&mdash; 
By this&mdash;was William Kidd 
Persuaded of the Buried Gold&mdash; 
As One had testified&mdash; 
Through this&mdash;the old Philosopher&mdash; 
His Talismanic Stone 
Discern&eacute;d&mdash;still withholden 
To effort undivine&mdash; 
'Twas this&mdash;allured Columbus&mdash; 
When Genoa&mdash;withdrew 
Before an Apparition 
Baptized America&mdash; 
The Same&mdash;afflicted Thomas&mdash; 
When Deity assured 
'Twas better&mdash;the perceiving not&mdash; 
Provided it believed&mdash; 
Truth—is As Old As God 
 
Truth—is as old as God— 
His Twin identity 
And will endure as long as He 
A Co-Eternity— 
And perish on the Day 
Himself is borne away 
From Mansion of the Universe 
A lifeless Deity. 
'Twas A Long Parting&Mdash;But The Time 
 
'Twas a long Parting&mdash;but the time 
For Interview&mdash;had Come&mdash; 
Before the Judgment Seat of God&mdash; 
The last&mdash;and second time 
These Fleshless Lovers met&mdash; 
A Heaven in a Gaze&mdash; 
A Heaven of Heavens&mdash;the Privilege 
Of one another's Eyes&mdash; 
No Lifetime&mdash;on Them&mdash; 
Appareled as the new 
Unborn&mdash;except They had beheld&mdash; 
Born infiniter&mdash;now&mdash; 
Was Bridal&mdash;e'er like This? 
A Paradise&mdash;the Host&mdash; 
And Cherubim&mdash;and Seraphim&mdash; 
The unobtrusive Guest&mdash; 
'Twas comfort in her Dying Room 
'Twas comfort in her Dying Room 
To hear the living Clock A 
short relief to have the wind 
Walk boldly up and knock Diversion 
from the Dying Theme 
To hear the children play But 
wrong the more 
That these could live 
And this of ours must die. 
Twas Crisis—all The Length Had Passed 
'Twas Crisis—All the length had passed— 
That dull—benumbing time 
There is in Fever or Event— 
And now the Chance had come— 
The instant holding in its claw 
The privilege to live 
Or warrant to report the Soul 
The other side the Grave. 
The Muscles grappled as with leads 
That would not let the Will— 
The Spirit shook the Adamant— 
But could not make it feel. 
The Second poised—debated—shot— 
Another had begun— 
And simultaneously, a Soul 
Escaped the House unseen— 
'Twas Just This Time, Last Year, I Died 
 
'Twas just this time, last year, I died. 
I know I heard the Corn, 
When I was carried by the Farms&mdash; 
It had the Tassels on&mdash; 
I thought how yellow it would look&mdash; 
When Richard went to mill&mdash; 
And then, I wanted to get out, 
But something held my will. 
I thought just how Red&mdash;Apples wedged 
The Stubble's joints between&mdash; 
And the Carts stooping round the fields 
To take the Pumpkins in&mdash; 
I wondered which would miss me, least, 
And when Thanksgiving, came, 
If Father'd multiply the plates&mdash; 
To make an even Sum&mdash; 
And would it blur the Christmas glee 
My Stocking hang too high 
For any Santa Claus to reach 
The Altitude of me&mdash; 
But this sort, grieved myself, 
And so, I thought the other way, 
How just this time, some perfect year&mdash; 
Themself, should come to me&mdash; 
'Twas Like A Maelstrom, With A Notch 
 
'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch, 
That nearer, every Day, 
Kept narrowing its boiling Wheel 
Until the Agony 
Toyed coolly with the final inch 
Of your delirious Hem&mdash; 
And you dropt, lost, 
When something broke&mdash; 
And let you from a Dream&mdash; 
As if a Goblin with a Gauge&mdash; 
Kept measuring the Hours&mdash; 
Until you felt your Second 
Weigh, helpless, in his Paws&mdash; 
And not a Sinew&mdash;stirred&mdash;could help, 
And sense was setting numb&mdash; 
When God&mdash;remembered&mdash;and the Fiend 
Let go, then, Overcome&mdash; 
As if your Sentence stood&mdash;pronounced&mdash; 
And you were frozen led 
From Dungeon's luxury of Doubt 
To Gibbets, and the Dead&mdash; 
And when the Film had stitched your eyes 
A Creature gasped "Reprieve"! 
Which Anguish was the utterest&mdash;then&mdash; 
To perish, or to live? 
'Twas Love—not Me 
 
'Twas Love—not me— 
Oh punish—pray— 
The Real one died for Thee— 
Just Him—not me— 
Such Guilt—to love Thee—most! 
Doom it beyond the Rest— 
Forgive it—last— 
'Twas base as Jesus—most! 
Let Justice not mistake— 
We Two—looked so alike— 
Which was the Guilty Sake— 
'Twas Love's—Now Strike! 
Twas Such A Little—little Boat 
 
'Twas such a little—little boat 
That toddled down the bay! 
'Twas such a gallant—gallant sea 
That beckoned it away! 
'Twas such a greedy, greedy wave 
That licked it from the Coast— 
Nor ever guessed the stately sails 
My little craft was lost! 
'Twas The Old—road—through Pain 
 
'Twas the old—road—through pain— 
That unfrequented—one— 
With many a turn—and thorn— 
That stops—at Heaven— 
This—was the Town—she passed— 
There—where she—rested—last— 
Then—stepped more fast— 
The little tracks—close prest— 
Then—not so swift— 
Slow—slow—as feet did weary—grow— 
Then—stopped—no other track! 
Wait! Look! Her little Book— 
The leaf—at love—turned back— 
Her very Hat— 
And this worn shoe just fits the track— 
Herself—though—fled! 
Another bed—a short one— 
Women make—tonight— 
In Chambers bright— 
Too out of sight—though— 
For our hoarse Good Night— 
To touch her Head! 
'Twas Warm—at First—like Us 
 
'Twas warm—at first—like Us— 
Until there crept upon 
A Chill—like frost upon a Glass— 
Till all the scene—be gone. 
The Forehead copied Stone— 
The Fingers grew too cold 
To ache—and like a Skater's Brook— 
The busy eyes—congealed— 
It straightened—that was all— 
It crowded Cold to Cold— 
It multiplied indifference— 
As Pride were all it could— 
And even when with Cords— 
'Twas lowered, like a Weight— 
It made no Signal, nor demurred, 
But dropped like Adamant. 
Twice Had Summer Her Fair Verdure 
 
Twice had Summer her fair Verdure 
Proffered to the Plain&mdash; 
Twice a Winter's silver Fracture 
On the Rivers been&mdash; 
Two full Autumns for the Squirrel 
Bounteous prepared&mdash; 
Nature, Had'st thou not a Berry 
For thy wandering Bird? 
Two Butterflies Went Out At Noon 
Two butterflies went out at noon 
And waltzed above a stream, 
Then stepped straight through the firmament 
And rested on a beam; 
And then together bore away 
Upon a shining sea,-Though 
never yet, in any port 
Their coming mentioned be. 
If spoken by the distant bird, 
If met in ether sea 
By frigate or by merchantman, 
Report was not to me. 
Two Swimmers Wrestled On The Spar 
 
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar&mdash; 
Until the morning sun&mdash; 
When One&mdash;turned smiling to the land&mdash; 
Oh God! the Other One! 
The stray ships&mdash;passing&mdash; 
Spied a face&mdash; 
Upon the waters borne&mdash; 
With eyes in death&mdash;still begging raised&mdash; 
And hands&mdash;beseeching&mdash;thrown! 
Two Travellers Perishing In Snow 
 
Two Travellers perishing in Snow 
The Forests as they froze 
Together heard them strengthening 
Each other with the words 
That Heaven if Heaven&mdash;must contain 
What Either left behind 
And then the cheer too solemn grew 
For language, and the wind 
Long steps across the features took 
That Love had touched the Morn 
With reverential Hyacinth&mdash; 
The taleless Days went on 
Till Mystery impatient drew 
And those They left behind 
Led absent, were procured of Heaven 
As Those first furnished, said&mdash; 
'Twould Ease—a Butterfly 
 
'Twould ease—a Butterfly— 
Elate—a Bee— 
Thou'rt neither— 
Neither—thy capacity— 
But, Blossom, were I, 
I would rather be 
Thy moment 
Than a Bee's Eternity— 
Content of fading 
Is enough for me— 
Fade I unto Divinity— 
And Dying—Lifetime— 
Ample as the Eye— 
Her least attention raise on me— 
Two—were Immortal Twice 
 
Two—were immortal twice— 
The privilege of few— 
Eternity—obtained—in Time— 
Reversed Divinity— 
That our ignoble Eyes 
The quality conceive 
Of Paradise superlative— 
Through their Comparative. 
Unable Are The Loved To Die 
 
Unable are the Loved to die 
For Love is Immortality, 
Nay, it is Deity&mdash; 
Unable they that love&mdash;to die 
For Love reforms Vitality 
Into Divinity. 
Uncertain Lease—develops Lustre 
 
Uncertain lease—develops lustre 
On Time 
Uncertain Grasp, appreciation 
Of Sum— 
The shorter Fate—is oftener the chiefest 
Because 
Inheritors upon a tenure 
Prize— 
Under The Light, Yet Under 
 
Under the Light, yet under, 
Under the Grass and the Dirt, 
Under the Beetle's Cellar 
Under the Clover's Root, 
Further than Arm could stretch 
Were it Giant long, 
Further than Sunshine could 
Were the Day Year long, 
Over the Light, yet over, 
Over the Arc of the Bird&mdash; 
Over the Comet's chimney&mdash; 
Over the Cubit's Head, 
Further than Guess can gallop 
Further than Riddle ride&mdash; 
Oh for a Disc to the Distance 
Between Ourselves and the Dead! 
Undue Significance A Starving Man Attaches 
 
Undue Significance a starving man attaches 
To Food&mdash; 
Far off&mdash;He sighs&mdash;and therefore&mdash;Hopeless&mdash; 
And therefore&mdash;Good&mdash; 
Partaken&mdash;it relieves&mdash;indeed&mdash; 
But proves us 
That Spices fly 
In the Receipt&mdash;It was the Distance&mdash; 
Was Savory&mdash; 
Unfulfilled To Observation 
 
Unfulfilled to Observation&mdash; 
Incomplete&mdash;to Eye&mdash; 
But to Faith&mdash;a Revolution 
In Locality&mdash; 
Unto Us&mdash;the Suns extinguish&mdash; 
To our Opposite&mdash; 
New Horizons&mdash;they embellish&mdash; 
Fronting Us&mdash;with Night. 
Unit, Like Death, For Whom? 
 
Unit, like Death, for Whom? 
True, like the Tomb, 
Who tells no secret 
Told to Him&mdash; 
The Grave is strict&mdash; 
Tickets admit 
Just two&mdash;the Bearer&mdash; 
And the Borne&mdash; 
And seat&mdash;just One&mdash; 
The Living&mdash;tell&mdash; 
The Dying&mdash;but a Syllable&mdash; 
The Coy Dead&mdash;None&mdash; 
No Chatter&mdash;here&mdash;no tea&mdash; 
So Babbler, and Bohea&mdash;stay there&mdash; 
But Gravity&mdash;and Expectation&mdash;and Fear&mdash; 
A tremor just, that All's not sure. 
Unto Like Story—trouble Has Enticed Me 
 
Unto like Story—Trouble has enticed me— 
How Kinsmen fell— 
Brothers and Sister—who preferred the Glory— 
And their young will 
Bent to the Scaffold, or in Dungeons—chanted— 
Till God's full time— 
When they let go the ignominy—smiling— 
And Shame went still— 
Unto guessed Crests, my moaning fancy, leads me, 
Worn fair 
By Heads rejected—in the lower country— 
Of honors there— 
Such spirit makes her perpetual mention, 
That I—grown bold— 
Step martial—at my Crucifixion— 
As Trumpets—rolled— 
Feet, small as mine—have marched in Revolution 
Firm to the Drum— 
Hands—not so stout—hoisted them—in witness— 
When Speech went numb— 
Let me not shame their sublime deportments— 
Drilled bright— 
Beckoning—Etruscan invitation— 
Toward Light— 
Unto Me? I Do Not Know You— 
"Unto Me?" I do not know you— 
Where may be your House? 
"I am Jesus—Late of Judea— 
Now—of Paradise"— 
Wagons—have you—to convey me? 
This is far from Thence— 
"Arms of Mine—sufficient Phaeton— 
Trust Omnipotence"— 
I am spotted—"I am Pardon"— 
I am small—"The Least 
Is esteemed in Heaven the Chiefest— 
Occupy my House"— 
Unto My Books—so Good To Turn 
 
Unto my Books—so good to turn— 
Far ends of tired Days— 
It half endears the Abstinence— 
And Pain—is missed—in Praise— 
As Flavors—cheer Retarded Guests 
With Banquettings to be— 
So Spices—stimulate the time 
Till my small Library— 
It may be Wilderness—without— 
Far feet of failing Men— 
But Holiday—excludes the night— 
And it is Bells—within— 
I thank these Kinsmen of the Shelf— 
Their Countenances Kid 
Enamor—in Prospective— 
And satisfy—obtained— 
Upon Concluded Lives 
 
Upon Concluded Lives 
There's nothing cooler falls&mdash; 
Than Life's sweet Calculations&mdash; 
The mixing Bells and Palls&mdash; 
Make Lacerating Tune&mdash; 
To Ears the Dying Side&mdash; 
'Tis Coronal&mdash;and Funeral&mdash; 
Saluting&mdash;in the Road&mdash; 
Victory Comes Late 
 
Victory comes late&mdash; 
And is held low to freezing lips&mdash; 
Too rapt with frost 
To take it&mdash; 
How sweet it would have tasted&mdash; 
Just a Drop&mdash; 
Was God so economical? 
His Table's spread too high for Us&mdash; 
Unless We dine on tiptoe&mdash; 
Crumbs&mdash;fit such little mouths&mdash; 
Cherries&mdash;suit Robbins&mdash; 
The Eagle's Golden Breakfast strangles&mdash;Them&mdash; 
God keep His Oath to Sparrows&mdash; 
Who of little Love&mdash;know how to starve&mdash; 
Volcanoes be in Sicily 
Volcanoes be in Sicily 
And South America 
I judge from my Geography -
Volcanos nearer here 
A Lava step at any time 
Am I inclined to climb A 
Crater I may contemplate 
Vesuvius at Home. 
Wait Till The Majesty Of Death 
 
Wait till the Majesty of Death 
Invests so mean a brow! 
Almost a powdered Footman 
Might dare to touch it now! 
Wait till in Everlasting Robes 
That Democrat is dressed, 
Then prate about "Preferment"&mdash; 
And "Station," and the rest! 
Around this quiet Courtier 
Obsequious Angels wait! 
Full royal is his Retinue! 
Full purple is his state! 
A Lord, might dare to lift the Hat 
To such a Modest Clay 
Since that My Lord, "the Lord of Lords" 
Receives unblushingly! 
Warm in her Hand these accents lie 
Warm in her Hand these accents lie 
While faithful and afar 
The Grace so awkward for her sake 
Its fond subjection wear 
Water Makes Many Beds 
Water makes many Beds 
For those averse to sleep Its 
awful chamber open stands Its 
Curtains blandly sweep Abhorrent 
is the Rest 
In undulating Rooms 
Whose Amplitude no end invades Whose 
Axis never comes. 
Water, Is Taught By Thirst 
 
Water, is taught by thirst. 
Land&mdash;by the Oceans passed. 
Transport&mdash;by throe&mdash; 
Peace&mdash;by its battles told&mdash; 
Love, by Memorial Mold&mdash; 
Birds, by the Snow. 
We Can But Follow To The Sun 
 
We can but follow to the Sun&mdash; 
As oft as He go down 
He leave Ourselves a Sphere behind&mdash; 
'Tis mostly&mdash;following&mdash; 
We go no further with the Dust 
Than to the Earthen Door&mdash; 
And then the Panels are reversed&mdash; 
And we behold&mdash;no more. 
We Cover Thee—sweet Face 
 
We Cover Thee—Sweet Face— 
Not that We tire of Thee— 
But that Thyself fatigue of Us— 
Remember—as Thou go— 
We follow Thee until 
Thou notice Us—no more— 
And then—reluctant—turn away 
To Con Thee o'er and o'er— 
And blame the scanty love 
We were Content to show— 
Augmented—Sweet—a Hundred fold— 
If Thou would'st take it—now— 
We Do Not Play On Graves 
 
We do not play on Graves&mdash; 
Because there isn't Room&mdash; 
Besides&mdash;it isn't even&mdash;it slants 
And People come&mdash; 
And put a Flower on it&mdash; 
And hang their faces so&mdash; 
We're fearing that their Hearts will drop&mdash; 
And crush our pretty play&mdash; 
And so we move as far 
As Enemies&mdash;away&mdash; 
Just looking round to see how far 
It is&mdash;Occasionally&mdash; 
We Don'T Cry—tim And I 
 
We don't cry—Tim and I, 
We are far too grand— 
But we bolt the door tight 
To prevent a friend— 
Then we hide our brave face 
Deep in our hand— 
Not to cry—Tim and I— 
We are far too grand— 
Nor to dream—he and me— 
Do we condescend— 
We just shut our brown eye 
To see to the end— 
Tim—see Cottages— 
But, Oh, so high! 
Then—we shake—Tim and I— 
And lest I—cry— 
Tim—reads a little Hymn— 
And we both pray— 
Please, Sir, I and Tim— 
Always lost the way! 
We must die—by and by— 
Clergymen say— 
Tim—shall—if I—do— 
I—too—if he— 
How shall we arrange it— 
Tim—was—so—shy? 
Take us simultaneous—Lord— 
I—"Tim"—and Me! 
We Dream—it Is Good We Are Dreaming 
 
We dream—it is good we are dreaming— 
It would hurt us—were we awake— 
But since it is playing—kill us, 
And we are playing—shriek— 
What harm? Men die—externally— 
It is a truth—of Blood— 
But we—are dying in Drama— 
And Drama—is never dead— 
Cautious—We jar each other— 
And either—open the eyes— 
Lest the Phantasm—prove the Mistake— 
And the livid Surprise 
Cool us to Shafts of Granite— 
With just an Age—and Name— 
And perhaps a phrase in Egyptian— 
It's prudenter—to dream— 
We Grow Accustomed To The Dark 
We grow accustomed to the Dark When 
light is put away As 
when the Neighbor holds the Lamp 
To witness her Goodbye 
A Moment -We uncertain step 
For newness of the night Then 
-fit our Vision to the Dark And 
meet the Road -erect 
And so of larger -Darknesses Those 
Evenings of the Brain When 
not a Moon disclose a sign Or 
Star -come out -within 
The Bravest -grope a little And 
sometimes hit a Tree 
Directly in the Forehead But 
as they learn to see 
Either the Darkness alters Or 
something in the sight 
Adjusts itself to Midnight And 
Life steps almost straight. 
We Learned The Whole Of Love 
 
We learned the Whole of Love&mdash; 
The Alphabet&mdash;the Words&mdash; 
A Chapter&mdash;then the mighty Book&mdash; 
Then&mdash;Revelation closed&mdash; 
But in Each Other's eyes 
An Ignorance beheld&mdash; 
Diviner than the Childhood's&mdash; 
And each to each, a Child&mdash; 
Attempted to expound 
What Neither&mdash;understood&mdash; 
Alas, that Wisdom is so large&mdash; 
And Truth&mdash;so manifold! 
We Like March, His Shoes Are Purple, 
We like March, his shoes are purple, 
He is new and high; 
Makes he mud for dog and peddler, 
Makes he forest dry; 
Knows the adder's tongue his coming, 
And begets her spot. 
Stands the sun so close and mighty 
That our minds are hot. 
News is he of all the others; 
Bold it were to die 
With the blue-birds buccaneering 
On his British sky. 
We Lose—because We Win 
 
We lose—because we win— 
Gamblers—recollecting which 
Toss their dice again! 
We Met As Sparks—diverging Flints 
 
We met as Sparks—Diverging Flints 
Sent various—scattered ways— 
We parted as the Central Flint 
Were cloven with an Adze— 
Subsisting on the Light We bore 
Before We felt the Dark— 
A Flint unto this Day—perhaps— 
But for that single Spark. 
We Miss Her, Not Because We See 
 
We miss Her, not because We see&mdash; 
The Absence of an Eye&mdash; 
Except its Mind accompany 
Abridge Society 
As slightly as the Routes of Stars&mdash; 
Ourselves&mdash;asleep below&mdash; 
We know that their superior Eyes 
Include Us&mdash;as they go&mdash; 
We Outgrow Love, Like Other Things 
 
We outgrow love, like other things 
And put it in the Drawer&mdash; 
Till it an Antique fashion shows&mdash; 
Like Costumes Grandsires wore. 
We Play At Paste, 
We play at paste, 
Till qualified for pearl, 
Then drop the paste, 
And deem ourself a fool. 
The shapes, though, were similar, 
And our new hands 
Learned gem-tactics 
Practising sands. 
We Pray&Mdash;To Heaven 
 
We pray&mdash;to Heaven&mdash; 
We prate&mdash;of Heaven&mdash; 
Relate&mdash;when Neighbors die&mdash; 
At what o'clock to heaven&mdash;they fled&mdash; 
Who saw them&mdash;Wherefore fly? 
Is Heaven a Place&mdash;a Sky&mdash;a Tree? 
Location's narrow way is for Ourselves&mdash; 
Unto the Dead 
There's no Geography&mdash; 
But State&mdash;Endowal&mdash;Focus&mdash; 
Where&mdash;Omnipresence&mdash;fly? 
We See&Mdash;Comparatively 
 
We see&mdash;Comparatively&mdash; 
The Thing so towering high 
We could not grasp its segment 
Unaided&mdash;Yesterday&mdash; 
This Morning's finer Verdict&mdash; 
Makes scarcely worth the toil&mdash; 
A furrow&mdash;Our Cordillera&mdash; 
Our Apennine&mdash;a Knoll&mdash; 
Perhaps 'tis kindly&mdash;done us&mdash; 
The Anguish&mdash;and the loss&mdash; 
The wrenching&mdash;for His Firmament 
The Thing belonged to us&mdash; 
To spare these Striding Spirits 
Some Morning of Chagrin&mdash; 
The waking in a Gnat's&mdash;embrace&mdash; 
Our Giants&mdash;further on&mdash; 
We Should Not Mind So Small A Flower 
 
We should not mind so small a flower&mdash; 
Except it quiet bring 
Our little garden that we lost 
Back to the Lawn again. 
So spicy her Carnations nod&mdash; 
So drunken, reel her Bees&mdash; 
So silver steal a hundred flutes 
From out a hundred trees&mdash; 
That whoso sees this little flower 
By faith may clear behold 
The Bobolinks around the throne 
And Dandelions gold. 
We Talked As Girls Do 
 
We talked as Girls do&mdash; 
Fond, and late&mdash; 
We speculated fair, on every subject, but the Grave&mdash; 
Of ours, none affair&mdash; 
We handled Destinies, as cool&mdash; 
As we&mdash;Disposers&mdash;be&mdash; 
And God, a Quiet Party 
To our Authority&mdash; 
But fondest, dwelt upon Ourself 
As we eventual&mdash;be&mdash; 
When Girls to Women, softly raised 
We&mdash;occupy&mdash;Degree&mdash; 
We parted with a contract 
To cherish, and to write 
But Heaven made both, impossible 
Before another night. 
We Thirst At First—'Tis Nature's Act 
 
We thirst at first—'tis Nature's Act— 
And later—when we die— 
A little Water supplicate— 
Of fingers going by— 
It intimates the finer want— 
Whose adequate supply 
Is that Great Water in the West— 
Termed Immortality— 
We—bee And I—live By The Quaffing 
 
We—Bee and I—live by the quaffing— 
'Tisn't all Hock—with us— 
Life has its Ale— 
But it's many a lay of the Dim Burgundy— 
We chant—for cheer—when the Wines—fail— 
Do we "get drunk"? 
Ask the jolly Clovers! 
Do we "beat" our "Wife"? 
I—never wed— 
Bee—pledges his—in minute flagons— 
Dainty—as the trees—on our deft Head— 
While runs the Rhine— 
He and I—revel— 
First—at the vat—and latest at the Vine— 
Noon—our last Cup— 
"Found dead"—"of Nectar"— 
By a humming Coroner— 
In a By-Thyme! 
Went Up A Year This Evening! 
 
Went up a year this evening! 
I recollect it well! 
Amid no bells nor bravoes 
The bystanders will tell! 
Cheerful&mdash;as to the village&mdash; 
Tranquil&mdash;as to repose&mdash; 
Chastened&mdash;as to the Chapel 
This humble Tourist rose! 
Did not talk of returning! 
Alluded to no time 
When, were the gales propitious&mdash; 
We might look for him! 
Was grateful for the Roses 
In life's diverse bouquet&mdash; 
Talked softly of new species 
To pick another day; 
Beguiling thus the wonder 
The wondrous nearer drew&mdash; 
Hands bustled at the moorings&mdash; 
The crown respectful grew&mdash; 
Ascended from our vision 
To Countenances new! 
A Difference&mdash;A Daisy&mdash; 
Is all the rest I knew! 
Wert Thou But Ill—that I Might Show Thee 
 
Wert Thou but ill—that I might show thee 
How long a Day I could endure 
Though thine attention stop not on me 
Nor the least signal, Me assure— 
Wert Thou but Stranger in ungracious country— 
And Mine—the Door 
Thou paused at, for a passing bounty— 
No More— 
Accused—wert Thou—and Myself—Tribunal— 
Convicted—Sentenced—Ermine—not to Me 
Half the Condition, thy Reverse—to follow— 
Just to partake—the infamy— 
The Tenant of the Narrow Cottage, wert Thou— 
Permit to be 
The Housewife in thy low attendance 
Contenteth Me— 
No Service hast Thou, I would not achieve it— 
To die—or live— 
The first—Sweet, proved I, ere I saw thee— 
For Life—be Love— 
What Care The Dead, For Chanticleer 
 
What care the Dead, for Chanticleer&mdash; 
What care the Dead for Day? 
'Tis late your Sunrise vex their face&mdash; 
And Purple Ribaldry&mdash;of Morning 
Pour as blank on them 
As on the Tier of Wall 
The Mason builded, yesterday, 
And equally as cool&mdash; 
What care the Dead for Summer? 
The Solstice had no Sun 
Could waste the Snow before their Gate&mdash; 
And knew One Bird a Tune&mdash; 
Could thrill their Mortised Ear 
Of all the Birds that be&mdash; 
This One&mdash;beloved of Mankind 
Henceforward cherished be&mdash; 
What care the Dead for Winter? 
Themselves as easy freeze&mdash; 
June Noon&mdash;as January Night&mdash; 
As soon the South&mdash;her Breeze 
Of Sycamore&mdash;or Cinnamon&mdash; 
Deposit in a Stone 
And put a Stone to keep it Warm&mdash; 
Give Spices&mdash;unto Men&mdash; 
What Did They Do Since I Saw Them? 
 
What did They do since I saw Them? 
Were They industrious? 
So many questions to put Them 
Have I the eagerness 
That could I snatch Their Faces 
That could Their lips reply 
Not till the last was answered 
Should They start for the Sky. 
Not if Their Party were waiting, 
Not if to talk with Me 
Were to Them now, Homesickness 
After Eternity. 
Not if the Just suspect me 
And offer a Reward 
Would I restore my Booty 
To that Bold Person, God&mdash; 
What I See Not, I Better See 
 
What I see not, I better see&mdash; 
Through Faith&mdash;my Hazel Eye 
Has periods of shutting&mdash; 
But, No lid has Memory&mdash; 
For frequent, all my sense obscured 
I equally behold 
As someone held a light unto 
The Features so beloved&mdash;
And I arise&mdash;and in my Dream&mdash; 
Do Thee distinguished Grace&mdash; 
Till jealous Daylight interrupt&mdash; 
And mar thy perfectness&mdash; 
What If I Say I Shall Not Wait! 
 
What if I say I shall not wait! 
What if I burst the fleshly Gate&mdash; 
And pass escaped&mdash;to thee! 
What if I file this Mortal&mdash;off&mdash; 
See where it hurt me&mdash;That's enough&mdash; 
And wade in Liberty! 
They cannot take me&mdash;any more! 
Dungeons can call&mdash;and Guns implore 
Unmeaning&mdash;now&mdash;to me&mdash; 
As laughter&mdash;was&mdash;an hour ago&mdash; 
Or Laces&mdash;or a Travelling Show&mdash; 
Or who died&mdash;yesterday! 
What Inn Is This 
 
What Inn is this 
Where for the night 
Peculiar Traveller comes? 
Who is the Landlord? 
Where the maids? 
Behold, what curious rooms! 
No ruddy fires on the hearth&mdash; 
No brimming Tankards flow&mdash; 
Necromancer! Landlord! 
Who are these below? 
What Is— 
 
What is—"Paradise"— 
Who live there— 
Are they "Farmers"— 
Do they "hoe"— 
Do they know that this is "Amherst"— 
And that I—am coming—too— 
Do they wear "new shoes"—in "Eden"— 
Is it always pleasant—there— 
Won't they scold us—when we're homesick— 
Or tell God—how cross we are— 
You are sure there's such a person 
As "a Father"—in the sky— 
So if I get lost—there—ever— 
Or do what the Nurse calls "die"— 
I shan't walk the "Jasper"—barefoot— 
Ransomed folks—won't laugh at me— 
Maybe—"Eden" a'n't so lonesome 
As New England used to be! 
What Shall I Do When The Summer Troubles 
 
What shall I do when the Summer troubles&mdash; 
What, when the Rose is ripe&mdash; 
What when the Eggs fly off in Music 
From the Maple Keep? 
What shall I do when the Skies a'chirrup 
Drop a Tune on me&mdash; 
When the Bee hangs all Noon in the Buttercup 
What will become of me? 
Oh, when the Squirrel fills His Pockets 
And the Berries stare 
How can I bear their jocund Faces 
Thou from Here, so far? 
'Twouldn't afflict a Robin&mdash; 
All His Goods have Wings&mdash; 
I&mdash;do not fly, so wherefore 
My Perennial Things? 
What Shall I Do—it Whimpers So 
 
What shall I do—it whimpers so— 
This little Hound within the Heart 
All day and night with bark and start— 
And yet, it will not go— 
Would you untie it, were you me— 
Would it stop whining—if to Thee— 
I sent it—even now? 
It should not tease you— 
By your chair—or, on the mat— 
Or if it dare—to climb your dizzy knee— 
Or—sometimes at your side to run— 
When you were willing— 
Shall it come? 
Tell Carlo— 
He'll tell me! 
What Soft—cherubic Creatures 
 
What Soft—Cherubic Creatures— 
These Gentlewomen are— 
One would as soon assault a Plush— 
Or violate a Star— 
Such Dimity Convictions— 
A Horror so refined 
Of freckled Human Nature— 
Of Deity—ashamed— 
It's such a common—Glory— 
A Fisherman's—Degree— 
Redemption—Brittle Lady— 
Be so—ashamed of Thee— 
What Would I Give To See His Face? 
 
What would I give to see his face? 
I'd give&mdash;I'd give my life&mdash;of course&mdash; 
But that is not enough! 
Stop just a minute&mdash;let me think! 
I'd give my biggest Bobolink! 
That makes two&mdash;Him&mdash;and Life! 
You know who "June" is&mdash; 
I'd give her&mdash; 
Roses a day from Zanzibar&mdash; 
And Lily tubes&mdash;like Wells&mdash; 
Bees&mdash;by the furlong&mdash; 
Straits of Blue 
Navies of Butterflies&mdash;sailed thro'&mdash; 
And dappled Cowslip Dells&mdash; 
Then I have "shares" in Primrose "Banks"&mdash; 
Daffodil Dowries&mdash;spicy "Stocks"&mdash; 
Dominions&mdash;broad as Dew&mdash; 
Bags of Doublons&mdash;adventurous Bees 
Brought me&mdash;from firmamental seas&mdash; 
And Purple&mdash;from Peru&mdash; 
Now&mdash;have I bought it&mdash; 
"Shylock"? Say! 
Sign me the Bond! 
"I vow to pay 
To Her&mdash;who pledges this&mdash; 
One hour&mdash;of her Sovereign's face"! 
Ecstatic Contract! 
Niggard Grace! 
My Kingdom's worth of Bliss!

When Diamonds Are A Legend 
 
When Diamonds are a Legend, 
And Diadems&mdash;a Tale&mdash; 
I Brooch and Earrings for Myself, 
Do sow, and Raise for sale&mdash; 
And tho' I'm scarce accounted, 
My Art, a Summer Day&mdash;had Patrons&mdash; 
Once&mdash;it was a Queen&mdash; 
And once&mdash;a Butterfly&mdash; 
When I Count The Seeds 
 
When I count the seeds 
That are sown beneath, 
To bloom so, bye and bye&mdash; 
When I con the people 
Lain so low, 
To be received as high&mdash; 
When I believe the garden 
Mortal shall not see&mdash; 
Pick by faith its blossom 
And avoid its Bee, 
I can spare this summer, unreluctantly. 
When I Have Seen The Sun Emerge 
 
When I have seen the Sun emerge 
From His amazing House&mdash; 
And leave a Day at every Door 
A Deed, in every place&mdash; 
Without the incident of Fame 
Or accident of Noise&mdash; 
The Earth has seemed to me a Drum, 
Pursued of little Boys 
When I Hoped, I Recollect 
 
When I hoped, I recollect 
Just the place I stood&mdash; 
At a Window facing West&mdash; 
Roughest Air&mdash;was good&mdash; 
Not a Sleet could bite me&mdash; 
Not a frost could cool&mdash; 
Hope it was that kept me warm&mdash; 
Not Merino shawl&mdash; 
When I feared&mdash;I recollect 
Just the Day it was&mdash; 
Worlds were lying out to Sun&mdash; 
Yet how Nature froze&mdash; 
Icicles upon my soul 
Prickled Blue and Cool&mdash; 
Bird went praising everywhere&mdash; 
Only Me&mdash;was still&mdash; 
And the Day that I despaired&mdash; 
This&mdash;if I forget 
Nature will&mdash;that it be Night 
After Sun has set&mdash; 
Darkness intersect her face&mdash; 
And put out her eye&mdash; 
Nature hesitate&mdash;before 
Memory and I&mdash; 
When I Was Small, A Woman Died 
 
When I was small, a Woman died&mdash; 
Today&mdash;her Only Boy 
Went up from the Potomac&mdash; 
His face all Victory 
To look at her&mdash;How slowly 
The Seasons must have turned 
Till Bullets clipt an Angle 
And He passed quickly round&mdash; 
If pride shall be in Paradise&mdash; 
Ourself cannot decide&mdash; 
Of their imperial Conduct&mdash; 
No person testified&mdash; 
But, proud in Apparition&mdash; 
That Woman and her Boy 
Pass back and forth, before my Brain 
As even in the sky&mdash; 
I'm confident that Bravoes&mdash; 
Perpetual break abroad 
For Braveries, remote as this 
In Scarlet Maryland&mdash; 
When Katie Walks, This Simple Pair Accompany Her 
Side 
 
When Katie walks, this simple pair accompany her side, 
When Katie runs unwearied they follow on the road, 
When Katie kneels, their loving hands still clasp her pious knee&mdash; 
Ah! Katie! Smile at Fortune, with two so knit to thee! 
When Memory is full 
When Memory is full 
Put on the perfect Lid This 
Morning's finest syllable 
Presumptuous Evening said 
When Night Is Almost Done 
 
When Night is almost done&mdash; 
And Sunrise grows so near 
That we can touch the Spaces&mdash; 
It's time to smooth the Hair&mdash; 
And get the Dimples ready&mdash; 
And wonder we could care 
For that old&mdash;faded Midnight&mdash; 
That frightened&mdash;but an Hour&mdash; 
When One Has Given Up One's Life 
 
When One has given up One's life 
The parting with the rest 
Feels easy, as when Day lets go 
Entirely the West 
The Peaks, that lingered last 
Remain in Her regret 
As scarcely as the Iodine 
Upon the Cataract. 
When Roses Cease To Bloom, Sir 
 
When Roses cease to bloom, Sir, 
And Violets are done&mdash; 
When Bumblebees in solemn flight 
Have passed beyond the Sun&mdash; 
The hand that paused to gather 
Upon this Summer's day 
Will idle lie&mdash;in Auburn&mdash; 
Then take my flowers&mdash;pray! 
When The Astronomer Stops Seeking 
 
When the Astronomer stops seeking 
For his Pleiad's Face&mdash; 
When the lone British Lady 
Forsakes the Arctic Race 
When to his Covenant Needle 
The Sailor doubting turns&mdash; 
It will be amply early 
To ask what treason means. 
When We Stand On The Tops Of Things 
 
When we stand on the tops of Things&mdash; 
And like the Trees, look down&mdash; 
The smoke all cleared away from it&mdash; 
And Mirrors on the scene&mdash; 
Just laying light&mdash;no soul will wink 
Except it have the flaw&mdash; 
The Sound ones, like the Hills&mdash;shall stand&mdash; 
No Lighting, scares away&mdash; 
The Perfect, nowhere be afraid&mdash; 
They bear their dauntless Heads, 
Where others, dare not go at Noon, 
Protected by their deeds&mdash; 
The Stars dare shine occasionally 
Upon a spotted World&mdash; 
And Suns, go surer, for their Proof, 
As if an Axle, held&mdash; 
Where Bells No More Affright The Morn 
 
Where bells no more affright the morn&mdash; 
Where scrabble never comes&mdash; 
Where very nimble Gentlemen 
Are forced to keep their rooms&mdash; 
Where tired Children placid sleep 
Thro' Centuries of noon 
This place is Bliss&mdash;this town is Heaven&mdash; 
Please, Pater, pretty soon! 
"Oh could we climb where Moses stood, 
And view the Landscape o'er" 
Not Father's bells&mdash;nor Factories, 
Could scare us any more! 
Where I Have Lost, I Softer Tread 
 
Where I have lost, I softer tread&mdash; 
I sow sweet flower from garden bed&mdash; 
I pause above that vanished head
 And mourn. 
Whom I have lost, I pious guard 
From accent harsh, or ruthless word&mdash; 
Feeling as if their pillow heard,
 Though stone! 
When I have lost, you'll know by this&mdash; 
A Bonnet black&mdash;A dusk surplice&mdash; 
A little tremor in my voice
 Like this! 
Why, I have lost, the people know 
Who dressed in flocks of purest snow 
Went home a century ago
 Next Bliss!

Where Thou art—that—is Home— 
Cashmere—or Calvary—the same—

So I may Come—

Bondage as Play—be sweet— 
Imprisonment—Content—

Whether My Bark Went Down At Sea 
 
Whether my bark went down at sea&mdash; 
Whether she met with gales&mdash; 
Whether to isles enchanted 
She bent her docile sails&mdash; 
By what mystic mooring 
She is held today&mdash; 
This is the errand of the eye 
Out upon the Bay. 
Whether they have forgotten 
Whether they have forgotten 
Or are forgetting now 
Or never remembered Safer 
not to know 
Miseries of conjecture 
Are a softer woe 
Than a Fact of Iron 
Hardened with I know 
While Asters&Mdash; 
 
While Asters&mdash; 
On the Hill&mdash; 
Their Everlasting fashions&mdash;set&mdash; 
And Covenant Gentians&mdash;Frill! 
While It Is Alive 
 
While it is alive 
Until Death touches it 
While it and I lap one Air 
Dwell in one Blood 
Under one Sacrament 
Show me Division can split or pare&mdash; 
Love is like Life&mdash;merely longer 
Love is like Death, during the Grave 
Love is the Fellow of the Resurrection 
Scooping up the Dust and chanting "Live"! 
Who Court Obtain Within Himself 
 
Who Court obtain within Himself 
Sees every Man a King&mdash;

To Him who doth continual 
Conspire against His Own

Who Giants know, with lesser Men

Who Never Lost, Are Unprepared 
 
Who never lost, are unprepared 
A Coronet to find! 
Who never thirsted 
Flagons, and Cooling Tamarind! 
Who never climbed the weary league&mdash; 
Can such a foot explore 
The purple territories 
On Pizarro's shore? 
How many Legions overcome&mdash; 
The Emperor will say? 
How many Colors taken 
On Revolution Day? 
How many Bullets bearest?

Who Occupies This House? 
 
Who occupies this House? 
A Stranger I must judge 
Since No one know His Circumstance&mdash; 
'Tis well the name and age 
Are writ upon the Door 
Or I should fear to pause 
Where not so much as Honest Dog 
Approach encourages. 
It seems a curious Town&mdash; 
Some Houses very old, 
Some&mdash;newly raised this Afternoon, 
Were I compelled to build 
It should not be among 
Inhabitants so still 
But where the Birds assemble 
And Boys were possible. 
Before Myself was born 
'Twas settled, so they say, 
A Territory for the Ghosts&mdash; 
And Squirrels, formerly. 
Until a Pioneer, as 
Settlers often do 
Liking the quiet of the Place 
Attracted more unto&mdash; 
And from a Settlement 
A Capital has grown 
Distinguished for the gravity 
Of every Citizen. 
The Owner of this House 
A Stranger He must be&mdash; 
Eternity's Acquaintances 
Are mostly so&mdash;to me. 
Who Were 'The Father And The Son' 
Who were 'the Father and the Son' 
We pondered when a child, 
And what had they to do with us 
And when portentous told 
With inference appalling 
By Childhood fortified 
We thought, at least they are no worse 
Than they have been described. 
Who are 'the Father and the Son' 
Did we demand Today 
'The Father and the Son' himself 
Would doubtless specify 
But had they the felicity 
When we desired to know. 
We better Friends had been, perhaps, 
Than time ensue to be 
We start -to learn that we believe 
But once -entirely Belief, 
it does not fit so well 
When altered frequently 
We blush, that Heaven if we achieve Event 
ineffable We 
shall have shunned until ashamed 
To own the Miracle 
Whole Gulfs -of Red, and Fleets 
Whole Gulfs -of Red, and Fleets -of Red And 
Crews -of solid Blood Did 
place upon the West -Tonight As 
'twere specific Ground 
And They -appointed Creatures In 
Authorized Arrays Due 
-promptly -as a Drama That 
bows -and disappears 
Whose Are The Little Beds, I Asked 
 
Whose are the little beds, I asked 
Which in the valleys lie? 
Some shook their heads, and others smiled&mdash; 
And no one made reply. 
Perhaps they did not hear, I said, 
I will inquire again&mdash; 
Whose are the beds&mdash;the tiny beds 
So thick upon the plain? 
'Tis Daisy, in the shortest&mdash; 
A little further on&mdash; 
Nearest the door&mdash;to wake the Ist&mdash; 
Little Leontoden. 
'Tis Iris, Sir, and Aster&mdash; 
Anemone, and Bell&mdash; 
Bartsia, in the blanket red&mdash; 
And chubby Daffodil. 
Meanwhile, at many cradles 
Her busy foot she plied&mdash; 
Humming the quaintest lullaby 
That ever rocked a child. 
Hush! Epigea wakens! 
The Crocus stirs her lids&mdash; 
Rhodora's cheek is crimson, 
She's dreaming of the woods! 
Then turning from them reverent&mdash; 
Their bedtime 'tis, she said&mdash; 
The Bumble bees will wake them 
When April woods are red. 
Whose Cheek Is This? 
 
Whose cheek is this? 
What rosy face 
Has lost a blush today? 
I found her&mdash;"pleiad"&mdash;in the woods 
And bore her safe away. 
Robins, in the tradition 
Did cover such with leaves, 
But which the cheek&mdash; 
And which the pall 
My scrutiny deceives. 
Whose Pink career may have a close 
Whose Pink career may have a close 
Portentous as our own, who knows? 
To imitate these Neighbors fleet 
In awe and innocence, were meet. 
Why Do I Love You, Sir? 
"Why do I love" You, Sir? 
Because— 
The Wind does not require the Grass 
To answer—Wherefore when He pass 
She cannot keep Her place. 
Because He knows—and 
Do not You— 
And We know not— 
Enough for Us 
The Wisdom it be so— 
The Lightning—never asked an Eye 
Wherefore it shut—when He was by— 
Because He knows it cannot speak— 
And reasons not contained— 
—Of Talk— 
There be—preferred by Daintier Folk— 
The Sunrise—Sire—compelleth Me— 
Because He's Sunrise—and I see— 
Therefore—Then— 
I love Thee— 
Why Do They Shut Me Out of Heaven? 
 
Why—do they shut Me out of Heaven? 
Did I sing—too loud? 
But—I can say a little 'Minor' 
Timid as a Bird! 
Wouldn't the Angels try me— 
Just—once—more— 
Just—see—if I troubled them— 
But don't—shut the door! 
Oh, if I—were the Gentleman 
In the 'White Robe'— 
And they—were the little Hand—that knocked— 
Could—I—forbid? 
Why Make It Doubt—it Hurts It So 
 
Why make it doubt—it hurts it so— 
So sick—to guess— 
So strong—to know— 
So brave—upon its little Bed 
To tell the very last They said 
Unto Itself—and smile—And shake— 
For that dear—distant—dangerous—Sake— 
But—the Instead—the Pinching fear 
That Something—it did do—or dare— 
Offend the Vision—and it flee— 
And They no more remember me— 
Nor ever turn to tell me why— 
Oh, Master, This is Misery— 
Wild Nights! Wild Nights! 
Wild Nights! Wild Nights! 
Were I with thee, 
Wild Nights should be 
Our luxury! 
Futile the winds 
To a heart in port, -Done 
with the compass, 
Done with the chart! 
Rowing in Eden! 
Ah! the sea! 
Might I but moor 
To-night in Thee! 
Will There Really Be A "Morning"? 
 
Will there really be a "Morning"? 
Is there such a thing as "Day"? 
Could I see it from the mountains 
If I were as tall as they? 
Has it feet like Water lilies? 
Has it feathers like a Bird? 
Is it brought from famous countries 
Of which I have never heard? 
Oh some Scholar! Oh some Sailor! 
Oh some Wise Men from the skies! 
Please to tell a little Pilgrim 
Where the place called "Morning" lies! 
Witchcraft Has Not A Pedigree 
Witchcraft has not a pedigree, 
‘Tis early as our breath, 
And mourners meet it going out 
The moment of our death. 
Witchcraft Was Hung, In History 
'Twas such a little -little boat 
That toddled down the bay! 
'Twas such a gallant -gallant sea 
That beckoned it away! 
'Twas such a greedy, greedy wave 
That licked it from the Coast Nor 
ever guessed the stately sails 
My little craft was lost! 
With A Flower 
I hide myself within my flower, 
That wearing on your breast, 
You, unsuspecting, wear me too And 
angels know the rest. 
I hide myself within my flower, 
That, fading from your vase, 
You, unsuspecting, feel for me 
Almost a loneliness.

Within My Garden, Rides A Bird 
 
Within my Garden, rides a Bird 
Upon a single Wheel&mdash; 
Whose spokes a dizzy Music make 
As 'twere a travelling Mill&mdash; 
He never stops, but slackens 
Above the Ripest Rose&mdash; 
Partakes without alighting 
And praises as he goes, 
Till every spice is tasted&mdash; 
And then his Fairy Gig 
Reels in remoter atmospheres&mdash; 
And I rejoin my Dog, 
And He and I, perplex us 
If positive, 'twere we&mdash; 
Or bore the Garden in the Brain 
This Curiosity&mdash; 
But He, the best Logician, 
Refers my clumsy eye&mdash; 
To just vibrating Blossoms! 
An Exquisite Reply! 
Within My Reach! 
 
Within my reach! 
I could have touched! 
I might have chanced that way! 
Soft sauntered thro' the village&mdash; 
Sauntered as soft away! 
So unsuspected Violets 
Within the meadows go&mdash; 
Too late for striving fingers 
That passed, an hour ago! 
Without This—there Is Nought 
 
Without this—there is nought— 
All other Riches be 
As is the Twitter of a Bird— 
Heard opposite the Sea— 
I could not care—to gain 
A lesser than the Whole— 
For did not this include themself— 
As Seams—include the Ball? 
I wished a way might be 
My Heart to subdivide— 
'Twould magnify—the Gratitude— 
And not reduce—the Gold—

Would you like summer? Taste of ours. 
Spices? Buy here! 
Ill! We have berries, for the parching! 
Weary! Furloughs of down! 
Perplexed! Estates of violet trouble ne'er looked on! 
Captive! We bring reprieve of roses! 
Fainting! Flasks of air! 
Even for Death, a fairy medicine.

Or other heights of Other Ones 
I've seen? 
Tell which—it's dull to guess— 
And I must be Rhinoceros 
Or Mouse— 
At once—for Thee— 
So say—if Queen it be— 
Or Page—please Thee— 
I'm that—or nought— 
Or other thing—if other thing there be— 
With just this Stipulus— 
I suit Thee— 
You See I Cannot See—your Lifetime 
 
You see I cannot see—your lifetime— 
I must guess— 
How many times it ache for me—today—Confess— 
How many times for my far sake 
The brave eyes film— 
But I guess guessing hurts— 
Mine—got so dim! 
Too vague—the face— 
My own—so patient—covers— 
Too far—the strength— 
My timidness enfolds— 
Haunting the Heart— 
Like her translated faces— 
Teasing the want— 
It—only—can suffice! 
You Taught Me Waiting With Myself 
 
You taught me Waiting with Myself— 
Appointment strictly kept— 
You taught me fortitude of Fate— 
This—also—I have learnt— 
An Altitude of Death, that could 
No bitterer debar 
Than Life—had done—before it— 
Yet—there is a Science more— 
The Heaven you know—to understand 
That you be not ashamed 
Of Me—in Christ's bright Audience 
Upon the further Hand— 
You'Ll Find—it When You Try To Die 
 
You'll find—it when you try to die— 
The Easier to let go— 
For recollecting such as went— 
You could not spare—you know. 
And though their places somewhat filled— 
As did their Marble names 
With Moss—they never grew so full— 
You chose the newer names— 
And when this World—sets further back— 
As Dying—say it does— 
The former love—distincter grows— 
And supersedes the fresh— 
And Thought of them—so fair invites— 
It looks too tawdry Grace 
To stay behind—with just the Toys 
We bought—to ease their place— 
You'Ll Know Her—by Her Foot 
 
You'll know Her—by Her Foot— 
The smallest Gamboge Hand 
With Fingers—where the Toes should be— 
Would more affront the Sand— 
Than this Quaint Creature's Boot— 
Adjusted by a Stern— 
Without a Button—I could vouch— 
Unto a Velvet Limb— 
You'll know Her—by Her Vest— 
Tight fitting—Orange—Brown— 
Inside a Jacket duller— 
She wore when she was born— 
Her Cap is small—and snug— 
Constructed for the Winds— 
She'd pass for Barehead—short way off— 
But as She Closer stands— 
So finer 'tis than Wool— 
You cannot feel the Seam— 
Nor is it Clasped unto of Band— 
Nor held upon—of Brim— 
You'll know Her—by Her Voice— 
At first—a doubtful Tone— 
A sweet endeavor—but as March 
To April—hurries on— 
She squanders on your Ear 
Such Arguments of Pearl— 
You beg the Robin in your Brain 
To keep the other—still— 
You'Ll Know It—as You Know 'Tis Noon 
 
You'll know it—as you know 'tis Noon— 
By Glory— 
As you do the Sun— 
By Glory— 
As you will in Heaven— 
Know God the Father—and the Son. 
By intuition, Mightiest Things 
Assert themselves—and not by terms— 
"I'm Midnight"—need the Midnight say— 
"I'm Sunrise"—Need the Majesty? 
Omnipotence—had not a Tongue— 
His listp—is Lightning—and the Sun— 
His Conversation—with the Sea— 
"How shall you know"? 
Consult your Eye! 
Your Riches—taught Me—poverty 
 
Your Riches—taught me—Poverty. 
Myself—a Millionaire 
In little Wealths, as Girls could boast 
Till broad as Buenos Ayre— 
You drifted your Dominions— 
A Different Peru— 
And I esteemed All Poverty 
For Life's Estate with you— 
Of Mines, I little know—myself— 
But just the names, of Gems— 
The Colors of the Commonest— 
And scarce of Diadems— 
So much, that did I meet the Queen— 
Her Glory I should know— 
But this, must be a different Wealth— 
To miss it—beggars so— 
I'm sure 'tis India—all Day— 
To those who look on You— 
Without a stint—without a blame, 
Might I—but be the Jew— 
I'm sure it is Golconda— 
Beyond my power to deem— 
To have a smile for Mine—each Day, 
How better, than a Gem! 
At least, it solaces to know 
That there exists—a Gold— 
Altho' I prove it, just in time 
Its distance—to behold— 
Its far—far Treasure to surmise— 
And estimate the Pearl— 
That slipped my simple fingers through— 
While just a Girl at School. 
You'Re Right— 
 
You're right—"the way is narrow"— 
And "difficult the Gate"— 
And "few there be"—Correct again— 
That "enter in—thereat"— 
'Tis Costly—So are purples! 
'Tis just the price of Breath— 
With but the "Discount" of the Grave— 
Termed by the Brokers—"Death"! 
And after that—there's Heaven— 
The Good Man's—"Dividend"— 
And Bad Men—"go to Jail"— 
I guess—
