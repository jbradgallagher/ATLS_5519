The nurseryman 
left behind 
a butterfly 
—Ryota 
Again and again 
stitching the rows of barley
a butterfly 
—Sora 
A pheasant's tail 
very gently brushes 
the violets 
—Shushiki-jo 
Over the violets 
a small breeze 
passes by 
—Ontei 
Each time the wind blows 
the butterfly sits anew 
on the willow 
—Basho 
Spring chill
above the rice paddies 
rootless clouds 
—Hekigodo 
Daybreak
the whitefish whiten 
only one inch 
—Basho 
Domestic ducks 
stretch their necks 
hoping to see the world 
—Koji 
The warbler 
dropped his hat
a camellia 
—Basho 
Crazed by flowers 
surprised by the moon
a butterfly 
—Chora 
White camellias
only the sound of their falling 
moonlit night 
—Ranko 
Squeaking in response 
to baby sparrows
a nest of mice 
—Basho
